<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>A
LETTER, &amp;c.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My Lord and Gentlemen</span>,</p>
<p>THE contemplated addition of a railway to your line of
conveyance, induces me to solicit the honour of your attention to
a method of effecting your object, which may, perhaps, prove the
cheapest and best you can adopt.</p>
<p>From the statements of the gentlemen who gave explanations on
the subject at the meeting, your object appears to be, to effect
some method of communication between your basin at Kensington,
and some point of the Grand Junction Canal, and the proposed
London and Birmingham Railway, which may enable you, either to
take advantage of the Grand Junction Canal as a channel to convey
and receive goods to and from, or of the proposed railway to
Birmingham; so that you may be able to convey passengers to and
from that railway, and to and from the western parts of town,
should it be put into operation.</p>
<p>Your present line being a water line, I should, were it not
for the intervention of the high ground which is between your
basin and the Grand Junction Canal, recommend the extension of
this water line; because an additional expenditure of
900<i>l.</i> or 1000<i>l.</i>, to provide a couple of the gigs by
which passengers are now conveyed at the rate of ten or twelve
miles an hour along the Paisley and Ardrossan Canal, would then
enable you to carry any number of passengers to and from the
Birmingham Railway considerably faster, and many times cheaper,
than omnibuses, &amp;c. &amp;c. would convey them to and from the
town end of that railway.</p>
<p>But as the numerous locks, which the height of that ground
renders necessary, would occasion the loss of all the time which
the newly-discovered method of rapid conveyance on canals might
save, the extension of your present line appears to be
incompatible with your object of rendering such extension adapted
to the rapid conveyance of passengers, as well as goods at the
usual rate.</p>
<p>This impediment is not, however, the only circumstance which
would make me pause in recommending the extension of your
canal.&nbsp; It is publicly stated that the estimated expense of
extending your canal the two and a half miles you contemplated
was 150,000<i>l.</i>; while this would not be the sole expense
attending it.</p>
<p>Owing to there being no water to supply the waste of the
numerous locks which you must construct, to raise barges to the
height you wish to surmount, you would have, in addition to
extending your canal, to be also at the expense of laying down
large water-pipes all along it; and of erecting steam-engines,
and pumps, to raise <i>up</i> from the Thames, every drop of the
water you would require to lower your barges <i>down</i> to
it.&nbsp; The first cost of doing this would be very
considerable: since, <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>in addition to the steam-engines, pumps, and two and a
half miles of large pipe which you must lay down, you must also
be at the expense of purchasing ground at the end of your
proposed extension, for the site of, and excavating the earth to
form, a large reservoir, for the water to be pumped up into to
supply the locks.</p>
<p>Great, however, as would be the first cost of thus providing
water to work the proposed extension of your canal, yet would
this first cost be less important than the current expenses of
it; since for every barge that passed through your canal, you
would have to pump above two hundred tons of water, nearly 100
feet high: than which, nothing can be conceived more contrary to
principles of economy; it being tantamount to having to lift a
<i>whole</i> hundred weight up, every time you extended your hand
to put a <i>quarter</i> of a hundred weight down.&nbsp; Were it
necessary that those two hundred tons of water should be pumped
<i>only</i> when you <i>raised</i> a barge <i>up</i> with (or by
means of) them, it would not be so vexatious.</p>
<p>But to be forced to pump two hundred tons <i>up</i>, in order
to float the smallest load a barge carries <a
name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a"
class="citation">[4a]</a> <i>down</i> your canal, would be so
contrary to all principles of economical conveyance, as well as
costly, that it becomes unavoidable to seek for some other means
of transmission.</p>
<p>That which first struck you as applicable to your object, was
a rail-way; since, by means of it, passengers may be conveyed as
well as goods; so that, should any circumstance connected with
the London and Birmingham Railway ever render it desirable, you
might, then, convey passengers along your line.&nbsp; But though
this could certainly be done, yet would the attainment of that
certainty be attended with an expense, which might prove greater
than the value of the purchase.</p>
<p>The avoidance of ascents which are at all abrupt, is now
stated to be of such consequence as relates to the diminution of
the daily expenses of railways, and so important with respect to
what locomotive engines can do upon them, that it is current as
the dictum of the principal engineer of the London and Birmingham
Railway, that it is better to lay down six miles of railway to
avoid (by going round it) a rise of 174 feet in one mile (an
ascent of about an inch in a yard, that is) than to carry one
mile of railway over said rise.&nbsp; And the junior engineer to
that railway stated before the Lords&rsquo; Committee, that for a
locomotive engine to get over a rise of fifty feet in height, was
&ldquo;nearly equal to going four miles round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fuel consumed being the principal item of expense in
locomotive engines, and the price of fuel with you being nearly
ten times greater than on the Liverpool and Manchester line, <a
name="citation4b"></a><a href="#footnote4b"
class="citation">[4b]</a> the attainment of the desideratum of as
regular an ascent as can be procured, becomes, according to this
doctrine, more important as relates to your line, than it would
be where fuel was cheaper, in proportion to the dearness of that
fuel.&nbsp; A regular plane of ascent may, therefore, be
considered indispensable to the proper operation of any railway
you might lay down</p>
<p>Were you to do the utmost that could be done towards obtaining
this regular plane of ascent, between your proposed points of
departure and arrival, by cutting and embanking so as to make <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>your line one
continuous inclined plane, it would still be so remote from a
level, as to rise at the rate of one foot of perpendicular height
for 154 feet of horizontal distance; which would make the power
required to draw any load along your line nearly twice as great
as that which would be requisite to draw the same load on a
level; while it would also present a sharper rise than some
railways where stationary engines are the only moving power
employed, owing to locomotives being considered unfit for
railways so inclined.</p>
<p>Supposing your line, which must have the same number of rails
that the Birmingham Railroad is to have (two lines of <i>way</i>
that is) to be no wider than that railway is to be in the
narrowest part, the amount of embanking necessary to render your
plane of ascent regular to this degree would not be so little as
one million of cubic yards.</p>
<p>In the evidence before the Lords&rsquo; Committee on the
London and Birmingham Railway it is stated, that on the Liverpool
and Manchester Railway there are about three millions of cubic
yards of cuttings and embankments.&nbsp; It being known that the
money paid by that Company for this purpose has exceeded two
hundred thousand pounds, it may be presumed that the expense of
one third of that amount of cutting and embanking on your line
would not be less than about 70,000<i>l.</i>; while, as the
nature of the ground your line must pass through, would render
the proportion of embankments much greater than that of
excavations, this amount of 70,000<i>l.</i> would be added to, by
your being actually compelled to purchase the earth <i>itself</i>
which would be required for those embankments, as well as to pay
for the labour of digging and conveying it to where you wanted
it.</p>
<p>Long lines of work being done for much less expense <i>per
mile</i> than short ones; the London and Birmingham Railway being
a very long line (112&frac12; miles); the engineers of that
railway having the very highest reputation as railway engineers;
and the estimates laid before Parliament by those gentlemen for
that railway, being the best authority it is possible to refer to
as relates to the probable cost of a railway&mdash;I shall, for
these reasons, and in order to prevent your supposing that my own
opinion affects my statement, advert to the anticipated expense
of that railway <i>per mile</i> as a measure of the cost of
yours.</p>
<p>Deducting the estimated expense of cutting and embanking, from
the <i>general</i> estimate of the London and Birmingham Railway,
the average estimated expense of the <i>other</i> work of the
<i>two</i> lines of way now proposed for that road (instead of
the <i>four</i> lines of which it was to consist) is
20,631<i>l.</i> per mile. <a name="citation5"></a><a
href="#footnote5" class="citation">[5]</a></p>
<p>And as it is not evident why your <i>short</i> line should be
done for <i>less comparative</i> expense than this long one
(while it is to be presumed that it would cost much more), it may
be assumed that the actual expense of attempting to make a
railway, on which the tractive force required for any load <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>would be nearly
twice as great as on a level, along the line you propose, would
not be so little as 100,000<i>l.</i></p>
<p>And, supposing that you should be willing to adopt the less
favourable method of railway transmission&mdash;i.e. levels and
steep inclined planes, with fixed engines on the
summits&mdash;still might not expense be very greatly
reduced?</p>
<p>The original estimate of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway
was 400,000<i>l.</i>, about 12,000<i>l.</i> per mile that is;
with respect to which the Quarterly Review for March 1825 says:
&ldquo;The estimate for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway we
have understood to be taken at 12,000<i>l.</i> per mile.&nbsp;
But that road is meant to be executed on a magnificent scale; to
be sixty-six feet wide; <a name="citation6"></a><a
href="#footnote6" class="citation">[6]</a> the rails to be laid
down in the best possible manner; and the purchase of land at the
extremities must be paid for at an enormous price.&nbsp; This
estimate also includes the cost of engines, waggons, and
warehouses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most unwisely, however, as well as untruly, the advocates of
railways attempt to deny, that the original estimate for the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway was so low as this, or that it
included the &ldquo;cost of engines, waggons, and
warehouses;&rdquo; in order to show that the actual cost of the
railways now contemplated will not exceed <i>their</i> estimated
expense, as the actual cost of the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway has exceeded that estimate.&nbsp; For the facts of the
case I appeal to the original prospectus of the Liverpool and
Manchester Railway, dated October 29, 1824; the 5th paragraph of
which document is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The ground has been surveyed by eminent
engineers, and the estimated expense of a railroad upon the most
improved construction, <i>including the charge for locomotive
engines to be employed upon the line</i>, <i>and other
contingencies</i>, is 400,000<i>l.</i> which sum it is proposed
to raise in 4000 shares of 100<i>l.</i> each.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It cannot, therefore, but be contrary to good sense as well as
fact, for the advocates of railways to attempt to deny evidence
of this nature.</p>
<p>The first line of the credit side of the account given in to
the Lords&rsquo; Committee on the proposed London and Birmingham
Railway, by the Treasurer of the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway, on the 24th June last, stands thus: &ldquo;By amount
expended (up to the 31st December, 1831) in completion of the
ways and works, 992,054<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&rdquo;:
while the same document says, &ldquo;By the additional number of
locomotive engines and carriages that will be required for the
increased number of departures, and especially by the outlay of
capital for the construction of the new tunnel, and the
unavoidable cost of warming, lighting, and working the same, the
Company will incur an increased annual expenditure, which will be
very inadequately compensated by the saving of the charge for
omnibuses.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, as exclusive of this
&ldquo;additional number of locomotive <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>engines and carriages that will be
required,&rdquo; the expense of making this tunnel is estimated
at 130,000<i>l.</i>&mdash;while, if the degree to which the
actual cost of the railway itself exceeded its estimated expense,
be taken as a rule, the actual cost of this tunnel may be nearer
400,000<i>l.</i> than 130,000<i>l.</i>&mdash;and, as the
following extract from the pamphlet entitled &ldquo;Remarks on
the Birmingham and London Railroad, by Investigator,&rdquo; shews
that an important item has been omitted, the <i>whole</i> expense
of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, up to the 31st December,
1831, will, it appears, exceed 1,200,000<i>l.</i> which is above
40,000<i>l.</i> per mile.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is a most important item entirely
omitted in the treasurer&rsquo;s account.&nbsp; Nearly
740,000<i>l.</i> were expended previous to May, 1830, all of
which has now been expended for nearly one year, and different
portions of it in different years, the first six years ago; not
one shilling has yet been returned back again; and, therefore,
the amount must be increased by the interest on the successive
sums expended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall not fatigue our readers with the details; but
the following abstract is very near the truth:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Omitting the odd hundreds, as we wish to be
under, rather than to exceed the truth, there must, therefore, be
95,000<i>l.</i> allowed for interest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Supposing, therefore, that you were to diminish the expense of
levelling, by adopting the system of steep inclined planes, with
stationary engines on the summits of them, to drag the loads up
by means of ropes, &amp;c., according to the usual course of the
stationary engine system, expense might not be very greatly
reduced.&nbsp; Since it appears, from the accounts laid before
Parliament, that, deducting the money paid for cutting and
embanking on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, as well as the
130,000<i>l.</i> of additional expenditure, which I have just
mentioned, the actual cost of that railway, <i>exclusive of
cuttings and embankments</i>, has really been so high as to
amount, very nearly, to 29,000<i>l.</i> per mile.</p>
<p>Even, therefore, if there were not a single yard of cutting
and embanking to be done on your line, the estimated expense of
the London and Birmingham, and the <i>actual</i> cost of the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway, bid you prepare yourselves for
an outlay of not less than 20,000<i>l.</i> per mile; while the
money actually paid on the latter, may well make you anticipate
that it would be nearer 30,000<i>l.</i> per mile; and this, as
has just been stated, <i>exclusive</i> of the expense of cuttings
and embankments.</p>
<p>There are persons who will deny this.&nbsp; But instead of
occupying your time by entering on any discussion of the question
here, I will merely refer you to the paragraph quoted on the last
page from the <i>original</i> prospectus of the Liverpool and
Manchester Railway, and to the following passage <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>from the
<i>second</i> prospectus issued by that company on the 26th
December, 1825, when the capital was raised to 510,000<i>l.</i>
instead of 400,000<i>l.</i>,&mdash;that is, to 17,000<i>l.</i>
per mile, instead of 12,000<i>l.</i></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A very prominent objection taken by the
opponents of the bill, was founded on the errors in the section
and levels, as exhibited before Parliament.&nbsp; These errors,
the Committee at once acknowledged and regretted; and, to avoid
all chance of similar complaint in future, they have engaged the
professional services of <i>most eminent engineers</i>, aided by
assistants of undoubted talents and activity; whose combined
efforts justify the fullest assurance, not only of the
correctness of the plans and sections, but that the whole line
will be laid and arranged with that skill and conformity with the
rules of mechanical science, which will equally challenge
approbation, whether considered as a national undertaking of
great public utility, or as a magnificent specimen of
art.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet, notwithstanding the &ldquo;undoubted talent&rdquo; of
those &ldquo;most eminent engineers,&rdquo; and their
&ldquo;assistants,&rdquo; whom the Committee had thus
&ldquo;engaged,&rdquo; the actual cost of the Liverpool and
Manchester Railway, has <i>more</i> than doubled the sum which
the &ldquo;undoubted talent&rdquo; of those engineers and their
assistants estimated it would cost, on the <i>second</i> survey
of the line.</p>
<p>The objections, therefore, of those who will say that I
overrate the expense of a railway, may not be more consistent
with fact, than the <i>under</i> estimate of these &ldquo;most
eminent engineers,&rdquo; and their &ldquo;assistants of
undoubted talents and activity:&rdquo; while if, after being a
<i>second</i> time surveyed and estimated, the Liverpool and
Manchester Railway cost a million and a quarter, instead of the
half million to which the revised and reconsidered estimates of
these &ldquo;most eminent engineers&rdquo; and their
&ldquo;assistants of undoubted talent and activity,&rdquo; raised
it, it becomes a simple rule of three question to estimate how
much the London and Birmingham Railway will cost, above the two
and a half millions, which it is now stated will complete the
double line that is to be laid down, instead of the quadruple
line which was stated to cost three millions.&nbsp; Of the four
sums which this railway has been estimated to cost (one and a
half millions; two millions; three millions; and two and a half
millions; vide note on page 5), nobody can tell which will be
right; though there are those who have publicly stated (and
staked their critical accuracy on its correctness), that the
whole four added together, will not be much more than enough.</p>
<p>It is true, that by having three <i>very</i> sharp
<i>indeed</i> inclined planes, of eight or ten feet perpendicular
ascent each an almost perfect level might, without very great
expense for cutting and embanking, be obtained for four-fifths of
your line to the Grand Junction Canal; while, by availing myself
of an ascending power possessed by locomotive engines, which has
(to my very great surprise) hitherto been overlooked, not only by
railway engineers in general, but also by the inventors and
improvers of locomotive engines, <a name="citation8"></a><a
href="#footnote8" class="citation">[8]</a> I could get your
engines and their loads up these ascents without any
difficulty.&nbsp; But as the rise, during the sixty feet
(nearly), of ascent, which must be surmounted in the remaining
fifth of your line to the Grand Junction Canal, must be at the
rate of one in forty-seven; as the power required to get the
loads you must be prepared to send up that ascent, <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>at the rate you
must also be prepared to <i>raise</i> them, will, including the
friction, &amp;c., of the ropes, render it necessary that the
stationary engines should, each of them, be, roundly speaking,
150 horses power&mdash;in consequence of these things, and owing
to the delay and danger attendant on the steep inclined plane and
stationary engine system, as well as for the following reasons,
this conjoint method of levels and steep inclined planes, and of
locomotive and stationary engines, might be little better for you
than making one continuous inclined plane of your line; so as to
admit of locomotives running over the whole of it; and,
consequently, not needing stationary engines at all.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the efficacy of steep inclined planes with
stationary engines on the summits, where they are absolutely
unavoidable, yet are they so objectionable where it is any how
possible to avoid them, that the engineers of the London and
Birmingham Railway have recommended cuttings and embankments to
the amount of twenty-three millions of cubic yards (nearly) in
order to avoid them; while evidence makes it appear, that the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway Company prefer keeping extra
locomotives waiting at the foot of their inclined planes, to draw
the trains up, rather than use the stationary engines, which, it
has been stated, they fixed at the top of those ascents for that
purpose.</p>
<p>But these general objections against steep inclined planes and
stationary engines, are not the only ones which would operate to
the rejection of this method on your proposed line.</p>
<p>To connect it with the London and Birmingham Railway, it must
either be carried over the Grand Junction Canal, or the London
and Birmingham Railway must be brought across that canal to come
to it; and as it may be divined that Mahomet must go to the
mountain, rather than that the mountain should come to Mahomet,
it may be concluded that your crossing the canal is unavoidable;
especially when it is considered that bringing the Birmingham
Railway over to the south side of the canal, would render
necessary a <i>second</i> crossing of it, in order to take that
railway back to the north side again.&nbsp; And as, exclusive of
the expense of the wide bridge, you must provide to carry your
line of railway across the canal, it would cause, first, a second
break, or variation, in your method of draught, by compelling
you, after taking the loads from the locomotive engines which
brought them from your basin to the foot of the ascent, and
getting them up that ascent by means of the stationary engines,
either to have other stationary engines adjoining the Birmingham
line, to get the loads from the canal to that line, or else to
transfer them for that purpose from the stationary engines, to
locomotives again; while, secondly, and in addition to this,
there would be the objection and opposition of the Grand Junction
Company, to the large stationary engines and buildings which you
must erect close to their canal to be overcome, it would appear
that a method which should avoid the, perhaps, fatal objections,
and certainly most enormously expensive Parliamentary opposition
of the Grand Junction Company to the proposed extension of your
line, would be a desideratum.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there must be the breadth of land
required for a railway; which, looking at the width necessary for
the embankments, would, considering the value of the ground
through which your line must run, render the surface purchase
(comparatively) equally expensive as the cutting.</p>
<p>Mere expense of purchase, might not, however, be the principal
objection to a railway along the line you contemplate.</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>According to the section of that line, the height of the
embankment it would be necessary to raise to give you a regular
plane of ascent, would so effectually divide the grounds you
passed through, as to prevent your bridging across such
embankment for private roads, and compel you to
&ldquo;tunnel&rdquo; under your own line, in order to admit of
communication between the divided properties you would intersect;
while, in the more level part, considerable expense for bridging
across it for the same purpose might be necessary.&nbsp; And let
you do the utmost that could be done, to inconvenience landowners
and occupiers as little as possible, it is impossible to avoid
giving them <i>real</i> cause for objection on this ground, for
the reasons pointed out in the following extract from a
publication on the London and Birmingham Railway.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Parts of estates and of fields will also be
separated from each other, by immense gashes and mounds; over and
under which expensive bridges, and long and wide tunnels, must
either be constructed, or the value of the land must be still
further deteriorated.&nbsp; Granting these to be constructed (and
they too would be an expense as great as the other), they would
not be an adequate compensation; for the passing and repassing of
the numerous flocks and herds by them, would completely trample
down and ruin the adjacent fields.&nbsp; There will also be
cutting of the veins that contain water; the springs and ponds
will in consequence be dried, and many of the sloping fields
adjoining the line so deprived of water, that they will either
become unfit for the purposes of pasturage, or the stock will
have to be driven to a distance for a supply, at a considerable
injury to its own value, and also at considerable
expense.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now as the opposition which, for these reasons only, the
landowners and occupiers made to the proposed London and
Birmingham Railway last session, was the cause of the bill being
thrown out by the Lords&rsquo; Committee; <a
name="citation10a"></a><a href="#footnote10a"
class="citation">[10a]</a> while, in addition to thus losing them
their bill, this opposition of the landowners and occupiers also
cost that company 50,000<i>l.</i> in parliamentary expenses, <a
name="citation10b"></a><a href="#footnote10b"
class="citation">[10b]</a> it may behove you to calculate
seriously the consequences of similar opposition; parliamentary
expenses being almost the same, whether a bill is for a railway
of 100 miles, or of only one mile in length.</p>
<p>But this <i>surface</i> expense of the road may still form its
least expense.&nbsp; Among the evidence before the Lord&rsquo;s
Committee on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, stands the
following item: &ldquo;Maintainance of way 6,599<i>l.</i>
12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&rdquo;&nbsp; This being for the six months
ending on the 31st December last, it appears that the expense of
keeping that railway in condition, notwithstanding that it has
been opened only two years, was at the rate of 438<i>l.</i> per
mile, per annum, for the last half of <i>last</i> year; an
amount, which, on your proposed line, would pay 5 per cent. on
above 20,000<i>l.</i></p>
<p>In the last <i>general</i> return made to Parliament, it was
stated that the average expense of <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>keeping the whole of the turnpike
roads of England in repair, was 68<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i>
0<i>d.</i>, per mile per annum.&nbsp; Therefore, it appears, that
the expense of keeping the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in
repair, is seven times as great as that of the average expense of
repairing the turnpike roads of England.</p>
<p>For the first half of the present year, these expenses seem to
have increased considerably in proportion.&nbsp; Since,
notwithstanding that the number of passengers carried between the
1st of January and the 1st of July, 1832, is less by above 82,000
than during the preceding six months (being only 174,122 instead
of 256,321), the repairs of the railway cost 7331<i>l.</i> in
that period, which is at the rate of 488<i>l.</i> per mile, per
annum.</p>
<p>On this and a corresponding subject, the Foreign Quarterly
Review for October, 1832, in its observations on two French
publications on railways, says, speaking of the Liverpool and
Manchester Railway,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The rails are not supported uniformly by
laying on the surface of the road, but rest upon stone pillars,
or sleepers, as they are called, placed at distances of a yard
from each other; and as the great weights pass over them with
considerable velocity, these sleepers are driven deeper into the
ground; so that the rail-road soon becomes uneven, one rail
having one direction, and the next a different one.&nbsp; Though
these defects are not easily detected by the eye, yet they are
very sensible upon close inspection with instruments; and still
more so by the carriages that pass over them, as the wheels, on
passing over a joining of two rails, receive a severe jolt, and
also a change of direction.&nbsp; Driven first on one side of the
road, then on the other, the carriage rocks like a ship at sea;
whilst, at every swing, one wheel or the other strikes a rail
with considerable violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The damage sustained by the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway, from these causes, is by no means trifling.&nbsp; On
examining the last half yearly statement printed for the use of
the subscribers, we find that the repairs of the railway cost
7331<i>l.</i> in six months; being more than 14,000<i>l.</i> per
annum. <a name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a>&nbsp; But the evil effects of this
action are by no means confined to the railway itself, they are
still more destructive to the engines that run upon it, as well
as the carriages; as the former, from their delicate mechanism,
receive the shocks with unmitigated violence; by which every bolt
is shaken loose, and even the strongest parts of the machinery,
are speedily torn to pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jolting they receive is very violent.&nbsp; We have
stood on one of them for hours, watching the action of the
springs, and have experienced, on our own bodies, every jolt of
the railway.&nbsp; The effect produced is most sensibly
perceived, where it is most sorely felt, in the revenue of the
company; for even at this moment, when their engines are new, and
in the best order, the expense incurred for their support and
repairs, is 10,582<i>l.</i> in six months; or above
21,000<i>l.</i> per annum, making, with the maintenance of the
road, 35,000<i>l.</i> of yearly expenditure; the greater part of
which is occasioned by the imperfections we have been
describing.&nbsp; This expense is easily accounted for, when we
consider that the company have twenty-four engines; out of which
there are seldom more than six fit for use; the others,
undergoing the progress of thorough repair.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Supposing this 10,582<i>l.</i> to be divided among the whole
twenty-four locomotives which are kept to do the work, the
expense of their repair is 882<i>l.</i> per engine, per
annum.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>But
supposing it to be divided only by the number of those which
<i>actually do the work</i>, this expense for repairs amounts to
3527<i>l.</i> per engine, per annum.</p>
<p>The Edinburgh Review for October, 1832, in some measure
accounts for this enormity of expense, by saying, &ldquo;It is
said that in the engines used on the Liverpool Railroad, new
grate-bars have been melted in a single trip; and the projector
of a steam carriage has admitted that cylindrical grate-bars, an
inch in diameter, could not last more than a week, when the
carriage is in constant work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now as you must have two locomotives (if not more) in constant
work, the money expended in their repairs, and in those of your
railway&mdash;supposing them to be equal to the similar expenses
of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway: and any circumstances
which should render them less remain yet to be made
known&mdash;this money would, provided it could be saved, pay 5
per cent. on a capital of nearly 170,000<i>l.</i>: an amount that
may render a method, the repairs and current expenses of which,
should be importantly less than this, not undeserving of your
attention.</p>
<p>In addition to these reasons against a railway, it may be
observed, that, supposing you were to lay down such a line of
communication for the purpose of conveying passengers to the
Birmingham Railway from the west end of London, it will be
necessary, not merely that those passengers should be willing to
be so conveyed by you, but also that they should be willing to
pay, not only <i>you</i> for carrying them to the Birmingham
Railway, but also other persons for bringing them to your railway
(which will be two miles and a half from Hyde Park corner), in
order that they may, thereby, be conveyed to the Birmingham
Railway: that is, they must pay you for carrying them thither,
over the space of two miles and a half, and other persons for
bringing them two miles and a half more from Hyde Park corner, in
order that you may so carry them.</p>
<p>Now as the Birmingham Railway crosses the Edgeware Road only
two miles and a half from the bottom of Oxford Street, it admits
of rather more than doubt, whether, even if you were to lay a
railway down, passengers for the Birmingham Railway would take
the circuitous, five-mile course, of the Kensington Road, and of
your line to it, when they could get thither, both for less
money, and in less time by the two and a half miles course of the
Edgeware Road.</p>
<p>Therefore, with a view, first, to obviate this objection, and
render the course by your proposed line, quicker in point of
time, as well as cheaper in point of expense, than the shorter
course by the Edgeware Road; and, in consequence, cause
passengers to the Birmingham Railway to give your line the
preference: second, in order importantly to reduce the cost of
the ground required for your proposed line: third, to remove the
objections of the owners and occupiers of this ground to a
railway being carried through their properties; and thereby save
you the expense, as well as the danger of their parliamentary
opposition: fourth, to avoid the opposition of, and the great
parliamentary expense you would be put to by, the Grand Junction
Canal Company: fifth, to furnish you with a cheaper (in point of
current expenses as well as first cost), and better method of
conveyance, than either canal or railroad will admit of: and,
sixth, to possess you of a source of income additional to, and
exclusive of, all that either canal or railway would bring
in:&mdash;for these six reasons,</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>I
solicit the honour of your attention to a method of conveyance,
which I beg leave to introduce to your notice, by the following
quotations:&mdash;</p>
<p>First, from the pamphlet of the gentleman who has informed the
world, that what all engineers have hitherto pronounced an
&ldquo;impossibility&rdquo;&mdash;rapid conveyance on canals that
is&mdash;is now proved perfectly practicable by passengers being
daily carried from Johnstone to Glasgow, along the Paisley and
Ardrossan Canal at rates of ten or twelve miles an hour: <a
name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a> and, second, from Philip&rsquo;s
History of Inland Navigation in England.</p>
<p>Adverting to the aqueducts by which the Union Canal is carried
over the various rivers in its course, Mr. Grahame
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Each and all of these aqueduct bridges are
higher than any on the Liverpool Railway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sankey viaduct bridge, which cost nearly as much as
all the other railway bridges put together, consists of nine
arches of fifty feet span; and is, at the highest point, sixty
feet in height.&nbsp; The Avon aqueduct, on the Union Canal,
consists of twelve arches, each fifty feet span; the greatest
height eighty-five feet; and the average height seventy-four feet
above the valley and river.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, it appears, that to carry a wide and deep canal
across rivers, is now a matter of as common occurrence, as to
build a suspension bridge, or a chain pier.&nbsp; Yet mark how
the first proposition for any thing of this kind was treated half
a century ago.</p>
<p>Philips, in his &ldquo;History of Canal Navigation,&rdquo;
speaking of the <i>first</i> proposition of the great father of
canal navigation in England to carry a canal across a river,
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When the first canal ever cut in England
was completed as far as Barton, where the Irwell is navigable for
large vessels, Mr. Brindsley proposed to carry it over that
river, by an aqueduct thirty-nine feet above the surface of the
water in the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, however, being considered as a wild and
extravagant project, he desired (in order to justify his opinion
towards his noble employer) that the opinion of another engineer
might be taken; believing that he could easily convince an
intelligent person of the practicability of the design.&nbsp; An
engineer of eminence was accordingly called; who, being conducted
to the place where it was intended that the aqueduct should be
built, ridiculed the attempt; and, when the height and dimensions
were communicated to him, he exclaimed, &lsquo;I have heard of
castles in the air, but never was shewn before, where any of them
were to be erected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This unfavourable verdict did not deter the duke from
following the opinion of his own engineer.&nbsp; The aqueduct was
immediately begun; and it was carried on with such rapidity and
success, as astonished all those who, but a little before,
thought it impossible; and within a twelvemonth did the crews of
the vessels navigating the Irwell see the duke&rsquo;s barges
sailing over their heads, in the channel, upborne by this
&lsquo;castle in the air.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now as the subject to which I solicit the honour of your
attention, though equally practicable as the passages which I
have quoted prove it to be to carry canals across rivers, will,
at first sight, appear still more aerial than was this denounced
&ldquo;castle in the air&rdquo; of the great introducer of canal
navigation in England; and, as the engineers of the present day
will pronounce it still more &ldquo;absurd&rdquo; and
&ldquo;impossible&rdquo; than his proposition was considered to
be, it behoves me to entreat, that you will vouchsafe a
correspondingly increased portion of forbearance, to what I
proceed to submit.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Many
years ago, a circumstance which it is not necessary I should
state, caused me to turn my attention to the best and cheapest
means of conveying our persons and goods from one place to
another.</p>
<p>After much consideration, a method of attaining these objects
suggested itself, which admitted of a rate of conveyance so
enormously rapid, and unprecedently cheap, as to be, at first
sight, rejected as one of those utterly impracticable
conceptions, which enter the imaginations of only poets and
visionaries.</p>
<p>Reflection, however, convincing me, that this idea was, in
point of fact, no more absurd than steam navigation, steam
conveyance on land, and gas lighting were deemed twenty years
ago, I took the same course with it which Fulton took with
respect to steam navigation, which Winsor took with gas lighting,
and which Trevithick and Vivian took as relates to locomotive
engines&mdash;that is, I proceeded to put it in practice.</p>
<p>For proofs of the scale on, and success with which I did this,
I beg to refer you to the following evidences of <i>fact</i>.</p>
<p>The first evidence I submit, is the copy of a circular which
was sent to the principal inhabitants of Brighton, by a number of
gentlemen, whose incredulity had been removed by witnessing and
experiencing the operation of the method of conveyance I refer
to.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Brighton, May 5,

class="citation">[14a]</a>) that it may be rendered very
advantageous to the town of Brighton, beg to solicit your
attendance, on Saturday the 12th May, at the Old Ship, at three
o&rsquo;clock.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Meetings, in consequence, took place, from the last of which
emanated the following requisition to the High Constable, to
convene a &ldquo;Town Meeting&rdquo; on the subject.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>&ldquo;To the

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;We, whose names are undersigned, do hereby request that
you will call a meeting of the inhabitants of the town of

conveyance of passengers and goods by atmospheric pressure,
beneficial to the town of Brighton.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[Signed by about eighty of the
inhabitants.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In consequence of this requisition, the High Constable took
the usual course of convening town meetings at Brighton, by
advertisements in the newspapers, and by crying, and placarding
the requisition all over the place, with the following addition
at the foot of it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In compliance with the above request, I do

class="smcap">Creasy</span>, H. C.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A &ldquo;town meeting&rdquo; accordingly took place; though,
prior to stating the resolutions which were then passed, I
solicit your attention to the following paragraph from the
Brighton Herald of the 16th September previous; for the reason,
that the explanation which it gives of the method alluded to, may
serve to render more evident the justness of the decision to
which the said &ldquo;town meeting&rdquo; came.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;NEW MODE OF
CONVEYANCE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our readers may remember that about two years ago, we
discussed, somewhat at large, a principle of motion, by which, it
was stated, we might be conveyed from one place to another ten
times as fast as we now travel; that is, one hundred miles an
hour instead of ten.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to say that
expedition such as this, appeared so utterly beyond what was
conceived to be within the bounds of possibility, that the theory
was consigned to the oblivion it seemed to merit; and the author
of it classed among those for whom, in the opinion of the world,
St. Luke&rsquo;s is the only fitting residence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General, however, as this opinion was, we have, during
the past week, witnessed that which most importantly counteracts
it as relates to ourselves; and could the doubts which the world
at large entertain on the subject, have been concentered in a
number of individuals, small enough to have both seen and felt
what was experienced by us, we see not how the whole world could
have avoided entertaining the opinion, that it is as certainly in
our power to cause ourselves to be conveyed from one place to
another at the rate of 100 miles an hour, by combining the
operation of the necessary apparatus, as it is to cause ourselves
to be conveyed at the rate of ten miles an hour, by adapting wood
and iron so as to form the combination of apparatus commonly
designated a stage coach; and that too, with a degree of safety
and convenience at which stage coaches can never arrive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be recollected that the principle, or theory
alluded to, was, that by properly combining the operation of
steam-engines and air-pumps, such as are daily used for certain
large manufacturing processes, we might create a kind of
artificial wind; which wind, if made to blow in a previously
constructed channel, would draw, or drive, a properly constructed
carriage, at <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>any rate not greatly exceeding what has been adverted
to.&nbsp; Since, as in manufacturing processes, air is daily
caused to move at rates varying from 200 to nearly 700 miles an
hour, a proper combination of the same apparatus must certainly
enable us to cause it to move at the lower rate of 100 miles an
hour; and, as the current of a river will carry a vessel down at
nearly the rate at which itself moves in its channel, so would
this current of air carry us along with a velocity nearly equal
to its own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, in brief, is the theory.&nbsp; What we have
witnessed of the practice is as follows.&nbsp; It being
impossible to give motion to the whole atmosphere, as nature does
when she causes a wind, we were first shown into a construction
which formed a channel, within which the motion of air could be
so directed as to cause it to blow full against any object placed
inside such channel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This channel (which is, in fact, a very large tunnel),
did not, in this instance, connect any two distant towns: it
being of a length sufficient only to illustrate the principle;
but it was self-evident that it (or another) might be extended to
any length required.&nbsp; On the bottom of this channel (or
tunnel) was a railway, on which ran a carriage.&nbsp; This
carriage had a circular end, composed of thin boards.&nbsp; This
circular end was as large as the tunnel, excepting about an inch
all round, and was fixed to the carriage, so as to stand across
the tunnel; as the sail of a ship stands across the line of her
length.&nbsp; Consequently, if motion were given to the air
within the tunnel, it would press, or blow, full against this end
of the carriage, and tend to push the carriage forward; as the
sails of a vessel going right before the wind are pressed against
by the atmosphere at large.&nbsp; Each end of this tunnel was so
connected to large air-pumps, that air could be drawn from one
end of it, while the atmosphere was at the same time permitted to
enter freely at the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After examining the construction of the apparatus
sufficiently to give us to understand as above, we got into the
carriage; and, on the air-pumps being set in motion, we were
moved along the railway from one end of the tunnel to the
other.&nbsp; When we arrived there the motion of the carriage was
reversed, and we were moved back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We continued riding in this way, until we became so
convinced that the invisible and intangible medium we breathe,
might be rendered a safe and most expeditious means of getting
from one place to another, as to be tired of riding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Further investigation gave us to perceive that the
carriage might be stopped, and its motion reversed at pleasure;
that so trivial was the degree of exhaustion (or vacuum)
necessary to enable the atmosphere to drive the carriage forward,
as the air-pumps drew the air from before it, that though we were
exposed to this &ldquo;vacuum&rdquo; (as it is called) at every
other turn of the carriage, yet did we experience no
inconvenience from it.&nbsp; In fact, our feelings gave us no
intimation on the subject, and we were wholly ignorant of it
until it was pointed out to us.&nbsp; We were satisfied that
persons or goods might be taken up, or set down, in any place
through which the tunnel ran, or whose trade or population were
at all important.&nbsp; And, as we were also convinced that it
would be impossible to be overturned, it was out of our power to
resist the belief that we had witnessed the operation of a
principle by which we may be conveyed more safely, more cheaply,
and many times more expeditiously, than we now travel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot expect to carry to the minds of those who
have not witnessed the operation of this principle, the
conviction felt by us who have.&nbsp; But of this we are
satisfied, that whoever sees it, <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>will, with us, be satisfied, that we
can render the principle practically effective, whenever we
choose to be at the expense of doing so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It stands now, exactly as the steam-engine stood, when
Watt had completed the first one he made: that is, certain in its
effect, provided we will be at the charge of combining the
necessary apparatus.&nbsp; We have steam-engines and air-pumps
amply large enough for the purpose.&nbsp; So far from there being
any insuperable difficulty in the construction of the tunnel,
there are parties ready to contract for, and guarantee the
execution of it, as relates to being air-tight; and, although we
should begin by going only at the rate of ten, fifteen, or twenty
miles an hour, yet have we no doubt that, in the time necessary
to instruct us how to manage the carriage under higher velocities
(as sailors get the &ldquo;trim&rdquo; of a new ship), we should
be able to go several (and we see not why <i>ten</i>) times
faster than we now travel.&nbsp; The chief, if not the only,
difficulty to surmount in this, as in most scientific
improvements in their origin, is public incredulity.&nbsp; This
difficulty was felt and experienced, at the outset, in respect to
the construction of steam-engines; in cutting canals; in laying
down rail-roads; in rendering steam-engines locomotive on them;
and superior to the tempest and the wave, at sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as the same spirit of perseverance which enabled us
to overcome these past difficulties, will cause us to triumph
over those before us with reference to this principle of motion,
we are satisfied, that it is necessary only to go on, and
prosper.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Brighton Herald</i>, 16<i>th</i>

<p>This quotation from the Brighton Herald serving to convey an
idea of the method of operation, I may return to the &ldquo;Town

the 7th June, 1827, states:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A town meeting, which we never saw
surpassed in respectability, and seldom more numerous, was held

<p>The <i>course</i> of the business not being important, I beg
to refer you to the columns of the Brighton Gazette for it, and
state only the <i>result</i>; which will be found

<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;TOWN OF
BRIGHTON.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a numerous and highly respectable Meeting of the
Inhabitants and Visitors of the Town of Brighton, held at the Old
Ship Tavern, on Tuesday, the 5th day of June, 1827, for the
purpose of taking into consideration the best means of rendering
the method invented by Mr. Vallance for the conveyance of
passengers and goods by atmospheric pressure, beneficial to the
Town of Brighton:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;The High Constable in the

<p>&ldquo;A Committee having been appointed at a former General
Meeting of the Inhabitants, to investigate the merits of the
measure now under consideration, and their Report having been

undertaking&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Report of the
Committee appointed at a Meeting of Inhabitants of Brighton, held
at the Old Ship, on Saturday, May 19, 1827:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In pursuance of a Resolution passed at a Meeting held
here, on Saturday, the 12th instant, your Committee have
inspected Mr. Vallance&rsquo;s apparatus for the conveyance of
passengers and goods by atmospheric pressure; and can bear
testimony to the success of it; having been repeatedly conveyed
through the cylinder <a name="citation18"></a><a
href="#footnote18" class="citation">[18]</a> laid down by that
gentleman in Devonshire Place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Committee are of opinion, that, in the event of
such a method of conveyance being established from one town to
another where much traffic exists, the advantages would be
incalculable, both as regards the ready transit, and saving of
time and expense to the traveller and merchant, as compared with
the ordinary mode of conveyance.&nbsp; Your Committee are
informed that 75,000 tons of materials are annually imported into
Brighton coastways, the greater part of which is landed at
Shoreham, and from thence brought into Brighton, at a land
carriage varying from 5<i>s.</i> to 8<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per
ton: and your Committee having been assured by Mr. Vallance, that
by his principle of conveyance, the carriage of all goods from
Shoreham might be reduced to a sum not exceeding 3<i>s.</i> per
ton, and yet a net annual profit of ten per cent. be returned on
the sum expended, are of opinion that if such a communication
were established between Brighton and Shoreham, it would
materially benefit the inhabitants of both towns; and your
Committee feel confident it would receive the most cordial and
general support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Committee beg further to report, that the opinions
of some of the highest scientific authorities upon the principle
of Mr. Vallance&rsquo;s proposition, have been submitted to them;
and they have the satisfaction to state, that these authorities
concur in the practicability of the measure to the fullest
extent; and the illustration of it which your Committee have
examined, appears to be on a scale of sufficient magnitude to
demonstrate the truth of such opinions.&nbsp; Should it,
therefore, be adopted between the town of Brighton and London, it
is impossible to calculate the important and beneficial changes
to which it may lead.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&ldquo;Your Committee, in conclusion, think that a
successful mode of transit by Mr. Vallance&rsquo;s apparatus,
would be attended with the most important advantages to this
great mercantile nation, and deem it entitled, not only to the
attentive consideration of the inhabitants of Brighton in
particular, but the community at large.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Committee, therefore, recommend, that a
requisition be addressed to the High Constable, to convene a
Meeting of the Inhabitants of Brighton, to take into
consideration the best means of furthering so important an
object.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;(Signed by the
Committee).&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In proof of the above statements, I beg to refer you to the
Records and Official Authorities of Brighton.</p>
<p>And, as a summary of the other persons who have witnessed and
experienced the effect of this method of conveyance, additional
to the parties already mentioned, I beg to submit the following
extracts from a Petition which I presented to Parliament on the
subject.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To the Honourable the Commons of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled; the
humble Petition of John Vallance, of Brighthelmstone, in the
County of Sussex,&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sheweth,</p>
<p>&ldquo;That your Petitioner hath invented a method of
conveyance, by which he can prove that persons may be carried
from one place to another very much faster, cheaper, and more
safely, in reference to security from personal danger, than can
be done on turnpike roads, or railways; and whereby be can also
prove that goods may be conveyed for less expense than by canal
carriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That to shew the public importance of this method of
conveyance, your Petitioner hath put it in operation, on a scale
capable of carrying twenty persons at once, over a space
sufficient to demonstrate its practicability; as hath been proved
by His Grace the Duke of Bedford, the Right Honourable the Earl
of Lauderdale, the Noble Baron Holland, and Lord William Russell;
who, with several other persons of distinction, at one and the
same time, rode in, and experienced the effect of it, on the 2nd
December, 1826.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That on the 16th May, 1827, a Committee of seven
Gentlemen, nominated at a Meeting of Inhabitants of Brighton,
also rode in, and experienced the operation of this method of
conveyance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That His Grace the Duke of Rutland, the Right
Honourable the Earl of Egremont, one of the honourable members
for Yorkshire, one of the honourable members for Lewes, Professor
Leslie, and many other gentlemen, have since witnessed and
experienced the effect of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it has also been seen by the Honourable Member for
Dundalk, by one of the Honourable Members for Essex, for London,
for Southwark, for Barnstable, for Callington, for Stafford, for
Petersfield, for Bedford, for Cambridge, for Bossiney, and for
Weymouth; with other noblemen and gentlemen too numerous to
mention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the whole of these noble and honourable gentleman
whom your petitioner hath mentioned, appeared to be, and it is
your Petitioner&rsquo;s belief, <i>were</i> convinced, that this
method of conveyance is equally practicable as steam navigation,
gas lighting, or locomotive steam-engines; notwithstanding that
before they witnessed and experienced the effect of it, they
deemed it more absurd and impossible than those now well known
triumphs of art were considered twenty years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the tunnel and other works whereby your Petitioner
hath produced this conviction, <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>combine the operation of the largest
pneumatic machinery in the world; the air pumps being capable of
exhausting above 50,000 cubic feet <a name="citation20"></a><a
href="#footnote20" class="citation">[20]</a> of air in a minute;
and of conveying 100 tons weight over a space equal to the
distance between Manchester and Liverpool, in three
hours;&mdash;while the tunnel is, in point of calibre and
strength, equal to the conveyance of the whole 1000 tons of goods
daily passing between those places, at one time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Petitioner humbly begs leave further to represent,
that the information he hath obtained during five years which he
hath devoted to investigations relative to the practicability,
cost, and advantages, of putting this method of conveyance into
operation between our principal manufacturing towns, the
outports, and the metropolis, will enable him to prove that it
may be done of cast iron, for an expense which would not exceed
what canals cost; while he can also prove, that in addition to
combining the trade of the turnpike road with that of the canal,
it would admit of goods being carried for less than half what
they can be carried for on canals; and passengers in less than
half the time, very much less than half the expense, and far more
safely with reference to security from personal danger, than can
be done on turnpike roads or railways; it being alike impossible
to be overturned, to be driven against any thing, or to break
down.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last evidence I adduce, is that of a Major of Engineers in
the Russian service; whom the late Emperor Alexander, after he
visited England, sent over to inspect and report upon our canals
and railroads.&nbsp; This officer was directed by the Russian
Ambassador to visit Brighton, expressly to inspect my plan; with
reference to which he addressed to his government a report, of
which he favoured me with the following copy:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">REPORT TO THE RUSSIAN
GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;To His Royal Highness Prince
Alexander, Duke of Wirtemburg, Chief of the Corps of Engineers
for the Inland Communications of Russia, General of Cavalry,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Royal Highness having commanded me to report upon
all the inventions of importance that have been brought forward
in England of late years, whether such were, or were not named in
the instructions I had the honour to receive from your Royal
Highness in St. Petersburgh in June 1824,1 beg leave most humbly
to submit the following particulars, relative to a proposed mode
of conveyance; differing from every existing system, as much as
it will surpass them in point of expedition and ultimate
economy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In March, 1825, I was informed that a Mr. Vallance had
invented a method of conveyance, by which goods might be
forwarded from place to place ten times faster than can now be
done; or equal to 100 miles per hour.&nbsp; The apparent
absurdity of the proposition, and the undefined explanation then
given, induced me to consider the scheme as one of the nefarious
and stock-jobbing bubbles of the day; consequently I took no
measures to become correctly informed on the subject;
particularly as I was about leaving London for an extensive
journey in the interior.&nbsp; Recent circumstances have,
however, caused me to entertain so different an opinion to that
which I then held on the subject, that I can now confidently
submit to your Royal Highness an account of a method of
conveyance, which will, in my humble opinion, within a few years,
operate a change in the condition <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>of the whole civilized world; and
which would be productive of the most important benefits to the
Russian Empire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The theory of this method is stated in the Treatise
marked with the letter A.&nbsp; The practice, I have experienced
personally: having been conveyed over a space sufficient to
demonstrate the practicability of the principle; and although
that space was not sufficient to admit of any such velocity being
attained as is adverted to in the Treatise, yet there is
sufficient evidence of the velocity with which air may be made to
move, to satisfy any one, that on a line of proper length, the
only limit to the rate at which persons or goods may be conveyed,
will be that at which wheels will revolve.&nbsp; I will, however,
first advert to the general object of the Treatise, and then
comment on those parts of it which I conceive to require further
illustration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Royal Highness will perceive, upon a perusal of
the treatise, that the general object of the author is to
prove,</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&nbsp; That it is practicable to render air a means
by which we may cause a peculiar sort of wheel carriage to convey
both passengers and goods ten times faster than horses can draw
any vehicle now in use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; That this may be done with perfect safety and
convenience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3.&nbsp; That we may, at one and the same time, move a
weight exceeding that of 100,000 infantry or 10,000 cavalry; and,
consequently, that a whole army may, in an hour, be transported
over a space of 100 miles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4.&nbsp; That this method of transmission may be put in
practice, for an expense per mile, far less than what several
canals have cost, as will be apparent from the amounts of the
several inland navigations of the United Kingdom, stated in my
Report of January last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;5.&nbsp; That the expense of transport by it will be so
many times less than by any present method, that military as well
as commercial benefits will result from it of the most important
nature; and</p>
<p>&ldquo;6.&nbsp; That the stoppages, inconveniences, and
delays, which would otherwise arise from those who have charge of
the exhausting apparatus at each end of the line of transit,
setting it in operation at an improper time, may be prevented by
the new mode of telegraphic communication described in the last
section of the Treatise, which, being equally efficient during
the most foggy weather and darkness, as in day light and clear
weather, will admit of instantaneous communication between those
who direct the operations at each end; so that any thing which it
may be necessary should be known at one end, may be
instantaneously communicated from the other, independent of the
method of conveyance itself; an arrangement, without which, the
operation of the principle would ever be attended with doubt,
delay, and danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vast importance which a method of transmission,
combining the advantages of tenfold expedition and cheapness,
must be, to an empire so extensive as that of Russia, I will not
presume to point out to your Royal Highness, but pass to those
particulars which appear to me to require further elucidation
than the author&rsquo;s object allowed of his giving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing is, the velocity at which the cause of
motion, in this method of transmission, viz. the air, would move
us, provided we could construct wheel carriages to go so
fast.&nbsp; This velocity would, if raised to its maximum, be
between 900 and 1000 miles an hour.&nbsp; But as saving
nine-tenths the time now wasted in travelling post, would render
the saving of portions of the remaining tenth, very unimportant,
it will be unnecessary to trouble your Royal Highness with <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>proof that it
might be possible to do so, in perhaps a large proportion; and I
therefore pass to the adduction of evidence, which shows that
<i>it is certainly in our power to save nine-tenths</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the examination I have given to the construction,
and what I have experienced as to the effect of the cylinder, or
large tube, in which I was conveyed, according to this principle
of transmission, I am convinced that exhaustion, to a degree
which should give fifteen inches of mercury, may be
effected&mdash;that is, half a vacuum; and as this would give an
initial velocity of between 200 and 300 miles an hour, there is
no reason to doubt but that a rate of motion equal to 100 miles
an hour may be attained, provided wheels can revolve so fast
without igniting.&nbsp; The operations of nature frequently
impart to air a velocity of above 100 miles an hour; and in the
process of fusing iron, it is artificially caused to move at
rates varying from 200 to nearly 700 miles an hour.&nbsp; At the
lower rate of 100 miles an hour, it must therefore be fully
practicable to make it move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second thing I advert to, is, the quantity in which
air may be exhausted, or taken out of a cylinder, or line of
large pipe, such as is adverted to.&nbsp; The blast cylinders
used instead of bellows, for fusing iron, are all air pumps, and
it is requisite only to arrange the valves properly, to render
them condensing or exhausting pumps at pleasure.&nbsp; Many of
these pumps are large enough to exhaust 10,000 cubic feet of air
per minute.&nbsp; Assuming the area of the cylinder to be 100
square feet, <a name="citation22a"></a><a href="#footnote22a"
class="citation">[22a]</a> and the velocity at which we are to be
conveyed to be 100 miles an hour, the combined operation of
eighty-eight of these pumps would be required.&nbsp; But the one
referred to in page 18, will take out 22,000 cubic feet per
minute; therefore, only forty such pumps as that would be
required to exhaust air from the cylinder at the rate of 100
miles an hour&mdash;a number, the operation of which there will
be no difficulty in combining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pressure requisite to cause air to move at the rate
of 100 miles an hour, appears, by all experiments that have been
made on the subject, to be less than half a pound per square
inch.&nbsp; Calculating from this datum the power requisite to
move a column of air equal to the area of the cylinder, at the
rate of 100 miles an hour, would be that of 1900 horses. <a
name="citation22b"></a><a href="#footnote22b"
class="citation">[22b]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;A steam engine of fifty horses&rsquo; power would,
therefore, be required to each air pump, to cause the air to move
at the rate of 100 miles an hour, independent both of the load to
be moved, and of the friction of the air against the inside of
the cylinder.&nbsp; With reference to the first of
these&mdash;the load to be moved&mdash;it is to be observed,
that, owing to the principle combining the operation of by far
the best railway I have ever seen, or, indeed, can conceive, with
carriage wheels six times as high as those used on the patent
single line railway, friction is diminished to a degree which
will admit of the same power moving a considerably greater weight
than on that railway.&nbsp; It will, therefore, be quite safe to
calculate only on the same effect being produced; and, according
to this the extra power requisite to move 100 tons at the rate of
100 miles an hour, would be only 200 horses.&nbsp; With reference
to the friction of the air against the inside of the cylinder, as
referred to at pages 68 to 74, several times the power will be
required; so that, were there no other means of power and
exhaustion than steam engines and air pumps, objection might
arise in point of expense.&nbsp; But, by what is stated at pages
50 and 51, it appears that neither air pumps nor steam engines <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>would be
indispensably necessary; and although Mr. Vallance does not at
present deem it prudent to give full explanation on this
particular, he informs me, that whenever it may be requisite, he
is prepared to prove that every purpose of exhaustion may be
effected without other apparatus than what he can construct out
of rough hewn trunks of trees; so that the question may be
considered free from any objections which the necessity for
costly machinery would give rise to in Russia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirdly, that a vehicle capable of carrying both
passengers and goods, can be so adapted to the inside of the
cylinder as to be moved in it by the air when operated upon by
the air pump, I can vouch, from having seen and experienced it;
and as the rate at which this vehicle moves, is exactly
commensurate with that at which the pumps exhaust air from the
cylinder, it follows, that, at whatever rate air can be pumped
out of the cylinder, the vehicle will be carried forward,
provided that velocity does not exceed the rate at which wheels
can revolve on their axes without ignition: with reference to
which, it is to be observed,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fourthly, that the number of revolutions made by a
carriage wheel depends on the size of that wheel, as well as on
the motion of the vehicle.&nbsp; The fore wheels of the coaches
which travel with the greatest expedition, revolve, on an
average, about 100 times in a minute.&nbsp; One of the peculiar
advantages of the method Mr. Vallance proposes, is, that it
admits of the wheels of the vehicles which move in the cylinder
being several times larger than the wheels of carriages which run
on roads; owing to their being always kept in an exactly
perpendicular position, and consequently free from the strain
thrown on the spokes of a common carriage wheel, by the
deflections from the perpendicular, which the nature of and
obstructions upon roads continually occasion.&nbsp; Owing to
this, the wheels of the vehicles which move in the proposed
cylinder may be from ten to twelve feet in diameter; or nearly
four times as large as the fore wheels of a coach.&nbsp; The same
number of revolutions, therefore, which the fore wheel of a coach
makes in an hour, would move the vehicle in the cylinder forty
miles; and twice and a half that number of revolutions would give
100 miles an hour.&nbsp; Now if a common coach wheel which moves
under the disadvantages of being constantly exposed to all the
clogging and impediments arising from the dust and dirt of the
road, can revolve for hours together at the rate of 100 times a
minute, without being greased, excepting at the end of its
journey of perhaps one hundred miles, it may fairly be presumed,
that a wheel which would be not only free from all dust and dirt,
but also moving in a reservoir of oil would revolve 250 times a
minute without heating, even had we no such evidence as that
referred to in page 36.&nbsp; But when that is taken into the
consideration, all anxiety with reference to the effect a
velocity of 100 miles an hour would have on the axes of the
wheels, may be dismissed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifthly, nor is it necessary that any anxiety should be
entertained, as to the effect such a velocity would have on
respiration; for in addition to what is urged on this matter at
pages 28, 29, and 35, I have to state that, though I was
purposely exposed to the &lsquo;vacuum&rsquo; as it is termed,
many times during my examination of, and riding in the cylinder,
yet I did not experience the least inconvenience from it.&nbsp;
Indeed, I should not have been aware of it, had my attention not
been directed to it; the degree of exhaustion necessary to move a
carriage, not being much more than the ten-thousandth part of a
vacuum: a diminution of density, which would not lower the
barometer so much as the two-hundredth part of an inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixthly, a degree of exhaustion, or vacuum, which is
not sufficient visibly to affect the barometer, being enough to
move the carriage with persons in it, so as for them to
experience the <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>effect, and fully comprehend the operation of the
principle, it becomes evident that the idea at first entertained
of a perfect vacuum being indispensable, is most erroneous; and
the objections which at first present themselves to us, relative
to the difficulty of constructing the cylinder&mdash;of making
the joints air tight, and of so adapting the ends of the vehicle
to the cylinder, as should prevent the passage of any important
quantity of air, without occasioning great friction, are all seen
to exist only in imagination.&nbsp; In the cylinder which Mr.
Vallance has in operation at Brighton, there is a space of above
an inch in width, purposely left all round between the cylinder
and the end of the carriage which forms the piston, against which
the air presses to drive the carriage along; yet does not the air
which rushes through this crevice (though it is in the whole
equal to an aperture of two square feet), prevent the operation
of the principle: its sole effect being a loss of a proportion of
the power employed to drive the air pumps; a loss which Mr.
Vallance intentionally submits to, for the sake of proving that a
very large portion of air may rush by the piston end of the
carriage, without preventing the effect of the
principle.&mdash;Vide pages 30 and 31.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventhly, nor will the degree to which it may be
necessary to exhaust, or, as it may in other words be termed, the
degree of &lsquo;vacuum&rsquo; required, to move even a very
great weight, interpose any insuperable difficulty.&nbsp; In the
cylinder at Brighton, a party, consisting of his Grace the Duke
of Bedford, the Earl of Lauderdale, Lord Holland, Lord W.
Russell, Lady W. Russell, and another lady and gentleman, were
all at the same time experiencing the operation of the principle,
on the day I was last at Brighton, with a degree of exhaustion
not exceeding two drachms per square inch; a proportion of vacuum
which would lower the barometer about one-hundredth of an
inch.&nbsp; Practice therefore proves, as well as the arguments
in pages 47 and 48, that a very trivial degree of exhaustion will
be sufficient to move a considerable load; and as it will be
perfectly practicable to exhaust to a degree, that should render
a barometer exposed to the vacuum inside the cylinder, several,
if not many inches lower than one would stand exposed to the
atmosphere, I do not think the amount stated in page 37 more than
it may be possible to move at one time.&nbsp; And with reference
to weights of 50 or 100 tons, such as locomotive engines draw at
once, there will certainly be no difficulty at all, let the
velocity they are moved at be what it may.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighthly, under the trivial degree of exhaustion which
will thus, generally speaking, be necessary, your Royal Highness
will perceive, that rendering the cylinder sufficiently air-tight
for the purpose, will be far less difficult than it is at first
supposed.&nbsp; Indeed, I see so many different ways of doing it,
that I am satisfied it would not, in practice, prove more
difficult, nor indeed so difficult, as causing some canals I have
seen, to retain the water let into them.&mdash;Vide p. 45.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninthly, nor will there be any difficulty in regulating
the motion of, and stopping the vehicle.&nbsp; The shortest way
of rendering this evident to your Royal Highness, will be to
suppose the end of the carriage which, when in motion, stands
across the cylinder, at a right angle with its course, to be
capable of turning on a pivot; so that it may be moved one
quarter of a circle, and placed in a line with the course of the
cylinder: or edge to wind, like a sail when it shivers.&nbsp; The
consequence of this would be, that as the air would pass by
without pressing against it, the power which moved the carriage
forward would be taken off; and as the wheel could at the same
time be dragged by a friction lever, while other levers caused
friction against the side of the cylinder, the progress of the
carriage could be commanded and stopped at pleasure.&nbsp; This
method of removing the effect of the pressure of the air against
the carriage, not being that which would be made use of in
practice, my <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>reason for adverting to it, is solely to enable your
Royal Highness to perceive, that a very simple arrangement will
admit of its being done.&nbsp; For the same reason, I only state,
that to the axis of each carriage, would be connected clock work,
which would shew the person who has charge of the carriage how
far he has gone, and where he is, to a yard; so that there will
be no uncertainty as to when and where to prepare for stopping,
by gradually diminishing the motion of the carriage.&nbsp; There
will be every facility for perfect vision, as at each end of
every carriage will be fixed a portable gas light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tenthly, this principle possesses an advantage over
common roads, as well as rail-roads and canals, which will, under
all circumstances, be generally, and, in some cases, highly
important.&nbsp; This advantage is, that the cause of motion (the
atmospheric pressure) will act vertically as well as
horizontally; and that in consequence of it, the filling up of
hollows, and also deep cutting, as for canals and rail-roads, is
unnecessary.&nbsp; Not that it would be advisable to select hilly
ground; though perfectly possible to go over any, the most abrupt
rises, even were they nearly perpendicular.&nbsp; But that any
rise or fall over which a carriage road can be cut, would be
quite level enough for the operation of the principle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleventhly, I now mention the expense per mile, which I
think will not, in Russia, exceed 10,000<i>l.</i>&nbsp; The
calculations on which this opinion is founded, I do not here
submit to your Royal Highness; but at such time as may be
necessary they will be ready for transmission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelfthly, the expense of transit, or carriage, by this
principle.&nbsp; Assuming that the combined effect of the
improved railway in the cylinder, and the six-fold diameter of
the wheels, should not render any given power capable of moving
more than on the single-line railway (vide my Report of August,
1825), one horse would move twenty tons; but independent of the
effect which the wheels, being six times larger, would have in
diminishing friction, the expense of transmission would be
diminished many times, from the following circumstances:&mdash;On
the single-line railway, the power employed is that of horses;
and, considering the construction of that railway, and the height
the rail must be in some situations above the ground, I do not
conceive that locomotive engines can be ever used upon it.&nbsp;
Horse-power is twenty-four times as dear as elementary power,
employed in the way the Treatise points out.&nbsp; Assuming,
therefore, that the friction of the rarified air against the
inside of the cylinder, as stated at pages 68 and 74, should
increase the power required ten times, still would the expense of
carriage be less than by the single line railway, while we should
attain the important advantage of being able to transmit 10,000
tons, at any rate between what railways now transmit at, and 100
miles per hour, for an expense which, as relates to power, would
be only the twenty-fifth part of a farthing per ton per mile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But even were the friction of the rarefied air against
the inside of the cylinder to increase the power required ten
times, as I have supposed, it is not imperative that the expense
of transmission must be increased in a similar degree.&nbsp;
Owing to its being well-known and universally received, steam is
the first mover, or power, Mr. Vallance has referred to.&nbsp;
The researches of men of science in England have, however, been
for some years directed to means of rendering the gases first
movers, instead of steam, under the hope of obtaining an agent,
which should serve as a mechanical first mover, without
fuel.&nbsp; From the year 1820, the attention of Mr. Vallance has
been directed to this subject, with a view of rendering the
method of conveyance the Treatise refers to perfect, in the
particular of cheapness of transmission; and about two years ago
he obtained a patent for a <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>first mover, which will give ten
times the power of steam, without any expense for fuel; the
principle of which is stated in the Tract, marked letter B, which
I have obtained from him, for the perusal of your Royal
Highness.&nbsp; The power therein referred to, proposed to be
used instead of steam, would so greatly reduce the expense of
transmission, that the cost of power would be ten times less than
by the single line rail-road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will also be equally superior in point of safety and
security from accidents, as it is in point of economy and
expedition: it being, as stated in page 81, absolutely impossible
to be overturned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus combining expedition exceeding that of posting,
with economy equal to that of canal transmission, it must appear
that this principle is most importantly advantageous to an empire
so vast in its extent as that of Russia, and, consequently, fully
authorizes me most strongly to recommend that the Government
should immediately contract with Mr. Vallance, to send a
practical illustration of the principle, such as he has in
operation at Brighton, which, being capable of carrying your
Royal Highness, the Members of the Council, and Generals of the
Arrondissements, over a space sufficient to demonstrate the
practicability of the proposition, will place within command a
reply to all objections from ignorant or interested persons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been deemed essentially important to the welfare
of Russia to promote internal communication by canals, and
immense sums have been expended in cutting them; but owing to the
long duration of winter, they are useless during half the year;
and so slow is the rate of transmission by them, that, even when
in full operation, they can hardly serve to convey goods from one
part of the empire to the other, before winter locks them up
again.&nbsp; Railways also, owing to the period the snow lays on
the ground, and the continual drifting of it which takes place,
would be available scarcely more than half the year.&nbsp; But
the principle here adverted to, being liable to interruption from
neither frost nor snow, and equally effective by night as by day,
offers a means of rendering the extremities of the empire
contiguous to each other; and will do this at a much less charge
than can ever be done by canals, or any other mode of
conveyance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vast importance of this principle to Russia, both
in a military and commercial point of view, it is unnecessary for
me to state to your Royal Highness; but I consider the manifold
advantages it presents sufficiently demonstrated, to prompt me to
recommend its speedy adoption from St. Petersburgh to
Tsarsko-selo, the river Volga, Moscow, and the Black Sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;London, Dec. 21, 1826.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With these evidences that I do not presume to request your
attention relative to a mere theory, I trust I may be permitted
to hope, that the following observations relative to effecting a
communication between your canal at Kensington and the point of
termination you propose, may be deemed not wholly undeserving
attention.</p>
<p>Were you to purchase land for either a canal or a railway, the
width required would not be less than sixty or seventy feet,
while in some parts it would be much more on account of the
cuttings and embankments. <a name="citation26"></a><a
href="#footnote26" class="citation">[26]</a></p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>Supposing the method which I submit to you were to be
adopted, a width of only eight feet would be necessary, even were
the tunnel to be carried, as a canal or railway must be, along
the surface of the ground; so that my proposition has, to
recommend it, this first feature, that only one-eighth of the
ground would be wanted that must be required for either a canal
or railway; while this recommendation would be attended with the
additional advantage, that, instead of the tunnel rendering the
lands through which it would pass, open, and liable to the
depredations of the bargemen and drivers, as canals or railways
do, it would, owing to communication going on <i>inside</i> the
tunnel, leave them still as private, untrenched upon, and
uninvaded, as a water or gas pipe would do.</p>
<p>In order, however, still more to obviate objections as to the
course, and additionally to reduce expense as to the nature of
the ground required for the line of communication which I
suggest, I propose carrying the tunnel <i>under</i> ground, in
lieu of upon it; while, instead of taking its course across
fields and cultivated grounds&mdash;as a canal or railway must
do&mdash;I propose taking it along the line of (though buried
underneath) certain bye-roads and (to coin a word) uncultivatible
grounds lying between your basin and the Grand Junction Canal,
and the line of the London and Birmingham Railway; by doing
which, I anticipate that very great expense, and still more
important opposition, will be avoided; while, as the farm-roads
and tracks, along and underneath which I propose to carry the
tunnel, would be so importantly improved by it, as to be rendered
almost equal to turnpike roads, the execution of the work would
be an actual benefit, instead of an injury to the land under
which it was carried.</p>
<p>In addition to these things, the line I propose would save
five per cent. on the whole cost; owing to its being in that
proportion shorter than the line pointed out on the plan for the
railway which was laid before the meeting.</p>
<p>The course I propose is as follows.&nbsp; 1st. Along the road
on the east of your basin, to the turnpike road; in which length
I should sink it so as to go under the turnpike.&nbsp; 2nd.
Diagonally across the turnpike to the bottom of Addison Road; up
and underneath which it would be continued to the Uxbridge
Road.&nbsp; 3rd. Under that road, and the farm yard and ground
opposite Addison Road, to the Green lane which runs upwards by
the side of Morland Hall; where would be the only
<i>cultivated</i> ground (and that only two or three furlongs)
which it might be necessary to purchase.</p>
<p>From this point it would go under the track to Notting Barn
Farm; and from thence under that farm yard up the track to the
bridge now crossing the Grand Junction Canal; where I propose
obviating any opposition of the Grand Junction company, by fixing
the bridge which must be thrown across to carry the tunnel,
<i>close</i> to that bridge; so that there would still be, as it
were, but one bridge for their barges to pass under.</p>
<p>From this point it might be carried under the short piece of
road leading to the Harrow Road; and thence, under and across
that road, up (though under) Kilburn Lane, to the line of the
London and Birmingham Railway.</p>
<p>There being only between three and four furlongs, which are
cultivatible throughout this route; and as the tunnel (being
carried under them) would be no impediment to the usual
operations of agriculture (unless some repair should, by chance,
be necessary, while the crops were on the <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>ground) the
expense of the ground line, would, comparatively, be not worth
speaking of; instead of proving the costly matter it would be, as
relates to a canal or railway.</p>
<p>And the foundation which the width of the
&ldquo;lengths&rdquo; of the tunnel would give for the railway
inside it, being thirty times greater than those of the bases on
which the rails of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway are laid
(<i>those</i> bases too, being of an extra and unusual size) the
tunnel would be less likely to need repair as relates to its
foundation, than the Liverpool and Manchester Railway is, by
thirty times.&nbsp; Indeed, owing to the less weight there will
be on each &ldquo;length&rdquo; of the tunnel, in comparison with
that thrown on the railway bases, the probability of repair
proving necessary will be less than this.</p>
<p>The stone blocks, or bases, which carry the rails of the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway are two feet square.&nbsp; The
weight of the large locomotive engines on that railway, is above
ten tons; more than half of which, being thrown on two of the
wheels, each block has three tons weight on it when those wheels
pass over it.&nbsp; The pressure on every square inch of the
foundations of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, is,
consequently, above four times as much as on the boilers of
Boulton and Watt&rsquo;s steam-engines; from which result the
sinkings, &ldquo;drivings into the ground,&rdquo; and the
twenty-fold more expensive repairs than were originally
calculated on, alluded to in the extract from the Foreign
Quarterly Review, given at page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page11">11</a></span>.</p>
<p>Now as the construction of the carriages which would go in the
tunnel, would prevent more than three tons being thrown on a
&ldquo;length&rdquo; of the tunnel; and as each of these
&ldquo;lengths&rdquo; would expose a base of 120 square feet to
the ground, the pressure on each square inch of the foundation of
the tunnel, would not be one-thirtieth of what it is on the bases
of the Manchester and Liverpool Railway; which, taken in
conjunction with the superior bases exposed by the tunnel, would,
perhaps, render the probability of sinking less than one
hundredth.&nbsp; It may, therefore, be presumed that after the
tunnel was once fairly set in its place, it never would be
necessary to disturb the ground over it.</p>
<p>Neither will the height to be surmounted by your extension,
prove an at all serious impediment to the effect of the principle
which the tunnel will enable us to put in operation.</p>
<p>As the pressure of the atmosphere, acting in all directions,
admits of a tunnel being effective even were it fixed vertically,
all gradations of ascent, fall, necessarily, within in its range;
with varieties of effect, increasing in proportion as their
angles approach the horizon.&nbsp; In consequence of this, the
height to be surmounted in the course of your extension, is
merely an impediment of degree; while the following circumstance
will render that degree comparatively unimportant.</p>
<p>Few things are better known than that a Stage Coachman, when
he approaches a rise of the road, pushes his horses to a gallop;
because &ldquo;the swing of the coach&rdquo; (as he expresses it)
&ldquo;carries his cattle up the hill.&rdquo;&nbsp; The principle
is known to every one; while it is almost equally well known that
the law of its operation, is according to the square of the
velocity; so that the momentum of a coach which meets the hill
with the horses pushed into a gallop that causes the rate of the
vehicle to be 16 miles an hour, will (friction abstracted) rise
four times as high as one that meets the hill when going at the
rate of 8 miles an hour: the continuance of the operation of the
power which overcame friction on the level, being (so far as
relates to its counteractive effect) equivalent to an
annihilation of friction.</p>
<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>This
law is well known.&nbsp; Now let us see how this knowledge has
been taken advantage of, by those who have had the expenditure of
hundreds of thousands, placed at their discretion.</p>
<p>Rates of from 35 to 40 miles an hour, have been attained on
the Liverpool and Manchester Railway for these four years.&nbsp;
Supposing friction to be counteracted and neutralized, the
momentum of a vehicle that was moving on a level at the rate of
36 miles an hour, would &ldquo;swing&rdquo; and cause it to rise
up an inclined plane to the height of 43&#8531; feet
perpendicular, let the angle of ascent, or rate of rise, be what
it might; while, as a velocity of 20 miles an hour, would, under
similar circumstances, &ldquo;swing&rdquo; a carriage up
13&#8531; feet perpendicular, and a velocity of 10 miles an hour,
3&#8531; feet perpendicular, it needs not, <i>nor ever has
needed</i> any thing more than a proper arrangement of levels and
inclined planes, to avoid <i>all</i> deep cutting, high
embanking, or tunnelling, in the line of a railway, except where
a precipitous rise or hollow interposed itself.</p>
<p>It is true that it may, with reference to the deep cuttings
and high embankments of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway be
replied, that at the time these works were executed, it was not
known that such great velocities could be attained on railways.
<a name="citation29a"></a><a href="#footnote29a"
class="citation">[29a]</a>&nbsp; But though it was not then
<i>known</i> that these rates of motion could be attained, yet
was it as well known as it is now, that rates of ten miles an
hour could be attained by horses: while, though the first line of
the railway was laid out in 1824, and the present line in 1825,
it was not till October, 1828, that it became decided whether
horse or elementary power should be employed: vide pages 62, 67,
68, and 69 of Mr. Treasurer Booth&rsquo;s &ldquo;Account of the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And notwithstanding that instances of velocities equal to ten
miles an hour having been attained by locomotive engines, were
not very common at the time the line of the Liverpool and
Manchester Railway was laid out, yet do the under-quoted extracts
from various publications of the period prove, both that they
<i>had</i> been attained, and that much higher velocities were
confidently anticipated: while Mr. Treasurer Booth, at page 37 of
his book, says, that &ldquo;the earth work (comprising the
cuttings and embankings along the whole line) was not commenced
till January, 1827.&rdquo; <a name="citation29b"></a><a
href="#footnote29b" class="citation">[29b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Such
statements being (as it were, officially) promulgated, and such
opinions entertained relative to the velocities attainable by
locomotive engines:&mdash;the question as to the employment of
horses being, thus, an open one, not only during the survey for
the second line, but also for two years and a half after the Act
for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was obtained; and it
being equally well known as it is that the sun gives light, that
for the gallop which coachmen push their horses to just before
touching a hill, in order to give their vehicles the momentum
which imparts the &ldquo;swing that carries their horses up the
hill&rdquo;, rates of 15 or 16 miles an hour could be
attained&mdash;it being thus known at the time the line of the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway was laid out, that average
velocities of 10, and occasional velocities of 15 miles an hour
could be attained: and it being unquestionable that if friction
be counteracted (as it is by the continuance of the operation of
the moving power) the momenta imparted by those velocities will
carry any vehicle up any inclined plane to the heights of
3&#8531; and 7&frac12; feet, it was necessary only to have laid
out the railway in short levels, with sharp inclined planes
rising a foot or two between them, to have avoided all deep
cutting or high embanking.</p>
<p>It is true that owing to velocities of ten miles an hour,
having at that time, been only occasionally attained by
locomotive engines, it might have been proper to keep these
ranges of levels, and inclined planes <i>within</i> the limit
prescribed by that rate.&nbsp; But as this limit is not within a
vertical rise of 3 feet 4 inches, it would have been perfectly
possible, by arranging short levels with sharp inclined planes of
three feet in height between them, to have avoided the
<i>whole</i> of those deep cuttings and high embankments of the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway, of which the under-quoted
extract from Mr. Treasurer Booth&rsquo;s book gives such glowing
descriptions. <a name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a></p>
<p>Admitting, however, (for the question&rsquo;s sake) that the
&ldquo;most eminent engineers&rdquo; and their <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>&ldquo;assistants of undoubted talents,&rdquo; by whom
these &ldquo;Pelion-upon-Ossa-like spoil banks, towering over the
adjacent land&rdquo; were ordered&mdash;and of which Mr. Booth
says, in addition, &ldquo;this aggregate mass has been removed to
various distances, from a few furlongs to between three and four
miles; and no inconsiderable portion of it has been hoisted up by
machinery from a depth of 30 to 60 feet&rdquo;&mdash;admitting
that these gentlemen should have been warranted in expending the
hundreds of thousands which were paid for making these mountains
between Liverpool and Manchester, by the uncertainty then
prevalent as to what velocities were attainable by locomotive
engines, it cannot be said that the engineers of the London and
Birmingham Railway have any similar justification to plead.&nbsp;
That line was not, I believe, laid out till 1831, while the
velocities attained on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, and
the short time within which London and Birmingham could, in
consequence, be brought of each other, form the main features of
the prospectus: rates of from 35 to 40 miles an hour having been
(then) <i>long</i> attained on the Liverpool and Manchester
railway.</p>
<p>Yet does the &ldquo;Estimate&rdquo; laid before Parliament
shew no less a sum than 429,286<i>l.</i> appropriated to
&ldquo;Excavations, Embankments, and Tunnelling,&rdquo; which,
with &ldquo;the increase in the number of arches in the Wolverton
viaduct,&rdquo; will give an <i>estimated</i> expenditure of
nearly half a million to do that, which, taking <i>proper</i>
advantage of the law of motion I am adverting to, would entirely
have saved; except where a hill as perpendicular as a wall, or a
hollow as precipitous as a well, rendered tunnelling, deep
cutting, or filling up, absolutely unavoidable.</p>
<p>At the time the Birmingham Railway was before Parliament last
session, maps of it were <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>issued from the office of that
company, which gave the &ldquo;Section of the line of railway;
shewing the rises and falls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This section is on too small a scale to shew either the height
of the embankments or the depth of the cuttings: and though it
has not suited my convenience to spare the time necessary for
examining the section deposited in Parliament, yet as the cubic
yards of cuttings and embankments amount to nearly twenty-three
millions: as the map and section I have just mentioned shew ten
tunnels (some of which are a mile and upwards in length): and
inclined planes, in <i>unbroken</i> rises of 6, 8, 10, 11, 13,
20, and 25 miles, there can be no doubt but that <i>much</i> deep
cutting and high embanking is included in it.&nbsp; Now though I
do not mean to imply that the expense of <i>all</i> cutting and
embanking could have been saved, by taking proper advantage of
the power of ascending heights, which is imparted by the momenta
of the velocities whereat locomotive engines now go, yet I do
mean to state it as my full conviction, that had this railway
been (as the second prospectus of the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway, stated that line should be) &ldquo;laid down and
arranged with that skill and conformity with the rules of
mechanical science, which will equally challenge approbation,
whether considered as a national undertaking of great public
utility, or as a magnificent specimen of art&rdquo; the whole of
the anticipated expenses of <i>deep</i> cutting and <i>high</i>
embanking would have been expunged from the estimates; it being
certain, that deep cuttings, high embankments, and <i>long</i>
inclined planes are no more evidences of engineering skill, than
winning a battle by hard fighting is of generalship: while the
expense of the numerous &ldquo;very small cuttings varying from 8
to 10 feet,&rdquo; which are spoken of in the &ldquo;Minutes of
Evidence taken before the Lords&rsquo; Committees,&rdquo; might
as certainly have been saved, and those rises passed over by the
vehicles in consequence of their momentum; as a cricket ball will
roll over a mole-hill.</p>
<p>But if these remarks are applicable to the Birmingham
Railway&mdash;the line of which, was I believe, laid out in
1831&mdash;what must be said relative to the <i>now</i> proposed
London and Bristol Railway?</p>
<p>For nearly twelve months the principle of avoiding level, and
constructing &ldquo;undulating railways&rdquo; has been
discussed, in consequence of Mr. Badnall having taken out a
patent for, and published a work, proposing such
&ldquo;undulating railways&rdquo;: and though, owing to the fall
on your line being wholly (as well as <i>greatly</i>) one way, it
is not necessary to express any opinion here on a proposition,
which appears to have for its object the construction of unlevel
railways <i>in preference</i> to level ones, and the labour of
toiling up hill for the sake of the momentum to be obtained by
running down hill, yet as, in consequence of it, the effect of
momentum in carrying moving bodies up ascents, has been largely
and widely adverted to for the last twelve months (nearly), it
must have been within the expectation of every one, that, let the
gentleman who has been employed to lay out the line of the
Bristol Railway be anxious as he might, to avoid any
&ldquo;undulating&rdquo; proposition, he would be equally anxious
to call in the aid of all <i>known</i> and <i>established</i>
principles, to diminish the expense of the line he was required
to lay down. <a name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32"
class="citation">[32]</a></p>
<p>Now, nothing, I believe, is more certain, than that if a
vehicle be moving along a level at the rate <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>of 2&frac34;
(2.7272) miles an hour, it will, on coming to an inclined plane,
and provided the operation of the power which overcame friction
on the level, be continued, so as to neutralise and (as relates
to counteractive effect) annihilate friction during the ascent,
&ldquo;swing&rdquo; itself up, and rise to the height of (that
is, its momentum will cause it to rise to the height of) three
inches perpendicular; let the angle of ascent, or rate of rise of
the plane, be what it may.</p>
<p>Equally certain is it, that if the velocity of the vehicle be
twice 2&frac34; miles an hour, that is 5.4544 miles, the momentum
will (under similar circumstances as to counteraction of
friction) then cause the vehicle to rise up said inclined plane
to four times the height to which the former velocity raised it;
or to the height of one foot.&nbsp; And it is equally certain,
that the momenta imparted by increased velocities will, under the
circumstance of the friction of the vehicle being overcome,
neutralised, and (as relates to counteractive effect)
annihilated, by the continued operation of the moving power
during the ascent, cause the vehicle to rise up any inclined
plane to the perpendicular heights stated in the following
table:&mdash;</p>

<p>Now, let it have been proper as it may, that the gentleman
whose name appears as &ldquo;Engineer&rdquo; to the Bristol
Railway, should (in laying out that line) have avoided
encumbering the subject with the &ldquo;undulating&rdquo;
question, there can be no doubt that it was incumbent on him to
diminish expense in every way which <i>established</i> principles
admitted.&nbsp; And as the usual railway rate is now 20 miles an
hour, while that rate will give momentum enough to cause any
vehicle to rise up any inclined plane to the height of 13&#8531;
feet (perpendicular) above the level on which it was running at
the rate of 20 miles an hour, it is necessary only to lay out the
line of this railway in levels, and rises of 10 feet each, to
avoid (very nearly, if not <i>quite</i>) all necessity for
cutting, or embanking; while <i>deep</i> cutting, <i>high</i>
embanking, and tunnelling, might (except in <i>very</i> peculiar
cases) have been as certainly avoided, as erecting a suspension
bridge will obviate the necessity for piers and arches over a
river.&nbsp; Yet does not this gentleman appear to have any more
called in the aid <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>of this law of motion, than did those equally
&ldquo;<i>eminent</i> engineers&rdquo; who laid out the line of
the Liverpool and Manchester Railway; or those who have laid out
that of the Birmingham Railway: the &ldquo;Report&rdquo; of the
public meeting held at Bristol, on the 30th July last, stating
that &ldquo;although the line of country (except for about 30
miles at the Bristol end) is <i>very advantageous</i>, yet the
comparative levelness of the railway will be attained by a
<i>great deal</i> of deep cutting, and <i>several</i>
tunnels;&rdquo; while the prospectus issued from the London
office of the Company states, that &ldquo;the construction of a
road so nearly level, in the hilly country about Bath and
Bristol, will, unavoidably, be a costly work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The length of the Birmingham Railway is 112&frac12; miles;
that of the Bristol Railway &ldquo;from 115 to 118 or 120
miles,&rdquo; average 117&frac12;.&nbsp; The estimated expense of
the cuttings, embankments, and tunnels, of the Birmingham Railway
is 429,286<i>l.</i> or 3,185<i>l.</i> per mile.&nbsp; The same
expense on the Bristol Railway is (835,300<i>l.</i> +
15,000<i>l.</i>=) 850,300<i>l.</i> or 7,236<i>l.</i> per mile;
that is, above twice as much: and this too, notwithstanding that
the Report states that &ldquo;this expensive part of the work,
fortunately, lies principally in two of the most favourable
materials&mdash;the chalk and the freestone;&rdquo; and also
notwithstanding that the estimate of the Birmingham Railway has
undergone two years&rsquo; scrutiny, and the most rigid
investigation, by several Parliamentary Committees; while that
for the Bristol Railway is the result of only a
&ldquo;<i>preliminary</i> survey,&rdquo; directed by a
&ldquo;Provisional Committee:&rdquo; so that were it to be
increased as the estimate for the Birmingham Railway has been
increased, it would be <i>many</i> times as much as the similar
work on that railway.&nbsp; Indeed, the parties themselves have
made a considerable increase already: 10 per cent. being added to
the above amount of 850,300 by the Bristol Committee, and 7 per
cent. by the London Committee; <a name="citation34a"></a><a
href="#footnote34a" class="citation">[34a]</a> so that
978,494<i>l.</i> is the <i>whole</i> amount at present allowed
for works, which taking proper advantage of the momentum of the
vehicles would have saved.</p>
<p>Yet, with well-known laws of motion thus set at nought and
neglected, and with expense thus unnecessarily as well as most
enormously added to, are the Committee&mdash;gentlemen who were,
unavoidably, as entirely dependant on the opinion of their
engineers, as the Ministry of 1789 were upon that of the
&ldquo;Insanity Doctors,&rdquo; relative to the mental affliction
of George III.; or as those of 1830 were on that of the
physicians who attended George IV. during his long
illness&mdash;under circumstances of such entire dependence on
the opinion of their engineers, are the &ldquo;Provisional
Committee&rdquo; of the Bristol Railway led into the following
expressions of approbation in their Report: &ldquo;The Committee
think it but justice to say, that the zeal, the diligence, the
<i>ability and other valuable qualities</i> manifested by these
gentlemen, have given them ample reason to congratulate
themselves on their choice&rdquo;!; and &ldquo;The Committee, in
conclusion, <i>repeat</i> that they have carefully availed
themselves of the resources of <i>skill and experience</i> in
investigating the probable cost of the railway.&rdquo; <a
name="citation34b"></a><a href="#footnote34b"
class="citation">[34b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Now as,
were I to presume to manifest &ldquo;skill, experience, ability,
and other valuable qualities,&rdquo; <i>such as these</i>, with
respect to your line, or thus to throw away, not only hundreds of
thousands, but also half millions, on any other, I should be sure
to experience the truth of that proverb, which says that merely
looking over the hedge shall subject one man to the operations of
&ldquo;the <i>finisher</i> of the law,&rdquo; while another man
may steal the horse with impunity, I must avail myself of this
law of motion, which &ldquo;skill, ability, experience, and other
valuable qualities&rdquo; so neglect and despise, to get loads up
the rise which you wish to surmount, without resorting to deep
cutting or high embanking.</p>
<p>Sixty feet of the rise to be surmounted, occurring in the last
half-mile of your line, I shall have nearly two miles to acquire
the necessary velocity in: and as the continuation of the action
of the power which overcame friction on the level, will
neutralise, and, as relates to counteractive effect, annihilate
the friction of the carriages while ascending these sixty feet, I
have only to cause them to attain a velocity somewhat greater
than has yet been attained on railways, that is, 42&frac12; miles
an hour during the two miles, to enable them to
&ldquo;swing&rdquo; themselves up these sixty feet, in
consequence of the momentum which that velocity will impart:
while, let the height of Rodway Hill (which is adverted to as so
desirable to avoid, in the Report of the Provisional Committee of
the Bristol Railway) be what it may, all that would be requisite
to obviate the necessity for the &ldquo;inclined plane and
stationary engine&rdquo; spoken of as unavoidable there, would be
to attain the velocity due to the altitude of said hill, to
enable my vehicles to surmount it from their momentum.</p>
<p>Nor would the ascending power imparted by the vertical
operation of the pressure of the atmosphere, be much less
important with respect to diminishing the expense of bridging, on
the line of this Bristol Railway, than would
&ldquo;momentum&rdquo; as relates to the expense of cutting <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>and
embanking.&nbsp; From the map issued from the London office of
that Company, it appears that that railway is to be carried five
times across the Avon; twice across the Kennet and Avon Canal;
three times across the Wilts and Berks Canal; and four times
across the Thames.&nbsp; These various crossings are not for the
sake of approaching places of magnitude, or commercial
importance; but solely because the <i>principle</i> of railway
transmission compels the level to be servilely adhered to: while,
though the right line distance between London and Bristol is only
108 miles, yet is the line of railway there laid down, shewn as
being 120 miles long; the 12 additional miles being added by the
curves taken in thus crossing these waters for the sake of the
level.</p>
<p>Now though I do not mean to say that it would be possible, by
laying down a tunnel instead of this railway, to avoid all
bridging whatsoever, yet owing to hills and rises being no
impediment to the operation of this principle, the line for a
tunnel might be several miles shorter than this line of the
railway, and yet the whole of these bridges be saved, excepting
one over the Avon; while not a quarter of the expense would be
incurred for carrying a tunnel over the waters which <i>its</i>
course must cross, which will be incurred in bridging the railway
over those other waters that intersect its course, which are not
laid down in the map shewing its line.</p>
<p>The estimated expense of bridging for the railway is
474,800<i>l.</i>; which, when increased by the per centages
allowed by the Committees, amounts to 556,194<i>l.</i> as the
whole <i>estimated</i> expense of bridging.&nbsp; What proportion
of this amount is for bridging over waters, and what for bridging
over roads, is not stated.&nbsp; On the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway 108,565<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> was expended on
63 bridges; of which only five were over waters: the other 58
being over roads, or to carry roads over the railway.&nbsp; On
the Birmingham Railway the number of bridges is 300; of which
only nine <i>are stated</i> to be over waters, the others being
for roads.&nbsp; The estimated amount of them is
350,574<i>l.</i>&nbsp; One bridge alone (the Sankey viaduct) on
the Liverpool and Manchester line, cost nearly
50,000<i>l.</i></p>
<p>Now as the power of going up or down, imparted by the vertical
operation of the pressure of the atmosphere, would render it
wholly immaterial whether the level was preserved in the line of
a tunnel; as burying it under ground, in the manner proposed at
page <span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page27">27</a></span>,
would equally do away with any occasion for the <i>many</i>
hundreds of bridges, which, on the three lines I have mentioned,
must be provided to carry those railways clear of roads, as it
would save bridging over the roads on your line; and as a tunnel
could have been carried <i>under</i> the Sankey, for almost
one-tenth of the expense it cost to construct the viaduct by
which the Liverpool and Manchester Railway is carried over that
canal&mdash;as my principle offers facilities of this kind for
obviating the necessity of bridging&mdash;I do not hesitate to
say, that, on the whole three lines, and considering how much the
actual, will exceed the estimated amounts, above one million
sterling might be saved in the item of bridging alone, by
substituting tunnels for railways; which, when added to, as it
would be, by the almost equal amount that would be saved in the
expense of the land, in consequence of my plan requiring a width
of only ten or a dozen feet <i>under</i> ground, instead of from
60 to 300 on the surface, will admit of my saying that (in round
numbers) nearly two millions might be saved by my plan, in these
two items of bridging and land, on the lines of the Liverpool and
Manchester, the London and Birmingham, and the London and Bristol
Railways: while, if what my plan would save of the
398,286<i>l.</i> allowed for the cost of land, and of the
261,928<i>l.</i> allowed for that of the entrances to London,
Bath, and Bristol, be added to the savings I have stated it would
effect in <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>bridging, cutting, embanking, and tunnelling, I may say
that it would also save nearly two millions (of the
<i>present</i> estimated expense) on the Bristol Railway
alone.</p>
<p>The ten times greater heights than I have yet specified, which
may be surmounted by combining the operation of the momentum of
the <i>air itself</i> with that of the vehicles, it is not
necessary for me to trouble you with, owing to the shortness of
your line, and the small height to be ascended: though it may be
permitted me to observe, that as attaining only equal velocities
to those which have been spoken of as attainable by locomotive
engines and steam-coaches, will enable my vehicles, of
themselves, to surmount hills of many hundred feet in height;
while combining with their momentum, the momentum of the air
itself (that which is <i>before</i> the vehicles; the friction
whereof will be overcome, and neutralised by the operation of the
exhausting apparatus) in tunnels of proper length, and loads of
corresponding weight, will enable me to ascend more thousands of
feet, than the momentum of the vehicles alone will carry them up
hundreds, I may be able to extend Louis le Grand&rsquo;s
exclamation, &ldquo;Il n&rsquo;y a plus des
Pyrenn&eacute;es,&rdquo; to &ldquo;il n&rsquo;y a plus des
montagnes sur la terre,&rdquo; so far as relates to their longer
preventing intercourse between countries; and consequently render
the whole earth level to us, in point of effect.</p>
<p>In reference to the force required to overcome the friction of
the medium by which the moving power operated to impel the
carriages, would a tunnel be also superior to a railway.&nbsp;
From Messrs. R. Stephenson and Locke&rsquo;s reply to Mr.
Walker&rsquo;s Report to the Directors of the Liverpool and
Manchester Railway, it appears that the friction of the ropes by
which stationary engines draw waggons up inclined planes, is
one-twelfth of their weight: while, as the latter part of your
line gives a sharper rise than that of the Liverpool tunnel, the
weight of the rope you must use should not be less than 7lbs. per
yard; the friction and gravitation of which would be 0.73231b.
per yard, or 1289lbs. per mile.&nbsp; The line in the plan for
the railway, which was laid before your meeting, being 2&frac12;
miles long, the whole resistance of friction and gravitation upon
it would be 3222 lbs.</p>
<p>From experiments on the friction of air in tubes, I am enabled
to state that both the inertia and friction of the air against
the inside of an equal length of the tunnel I propose to you to
lay down would not, when said air was moved <i>by exhaustion</i>,
and conveying 50 tons at the same rate at which the same quantity
is drawn up the tunnel of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway
(i.e. ten miles an hour), be so much as one sixteenth part of
this; while it would have this important advantage, that the
heavier the load was, the less would be both the inertia and
friction of the air.&nbsp; For instance: the degree of exhaustion
requisite to admit of an equal load to what is drawn up the
Liverpool tunnel (i.e. 50 tons) being moved up a tunnel of the
same size as that I constructed at Brighton, and rising at the
same rate your&rsquo;s must rise (1 in 47) by the pressure of the
atmosphere, would be about the 40th part of a vacuum.</p>
<p>But supposing ten times this load were to be raised, the
degree of exhaustion must be ten times as great, or about the
fourth of a vacuum.&nbsp; And, as the greater the exhaustion, the
less the expansive power, and, consequently the less the inertia
and friction of the air inside the exhausted part of the tunnel,
this &ldquo;rope of air&rdquo; as it has, derisively, been
called, possesses the important advantage of decreasing as
relates to the density, inertia, and friction, which
<i>itself</i> opposes, in proportion to the increase of the load
drawn by it: while, as the valves I should place at every
quarter, or half, or whole mile, to be opened by the carriages as
they pass them, and admit air immediately behind said carriages,
would prevent there being the inertia and friction of more than
<a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>a few
hundred yards of air of the <i>natural</i> density behind the
carriages to be overcome, the impediment which presents an
insuperable obstacle in the opinion of the numbers who have
condemned the proposition (because they deemed operating by
exhaustion the same as operating per plenum) diminishes, in point
of fact, to a far less important hindrance, than that which is
occasioned by the old system of drawing loads by means of
stationary engines and ropes; since, in the present instance, the
inertia and friction would not be the one-hundred-and-sixtieth
part of what it would be, to move an equal quantity by the
stationary engine, and rope system.</p>
<p>And notwithstanding that the superiority which the tunnel
possesses over the locomotive system is not so great at this, yet
is it important.</p>
<p>In the instructions given to Mr. Walker by the Directors of
the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (and which called from him
the Report criticised by Messrs. R. Stephenson and Locke), it is
stated that &ldquo;the quantity of traffic for which it will be
expedient to provide the power of conveyance&rdquo; is about 4000
tons, from each to the other of those places, daily.</p>
<p>In his publication on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway,
Dr. Lardner says, &ldquo;In the experiments which I have
detailed, it appears that a steam engine is capable of drawing 90
tons at the rate of about 20 miles an hour; and that it could
transport that weight twice between Liverpool and Manchester in
about three hours.&rdquo; <a name="citation38a"></a><a
href="#footnote38a" class="citation">[38a]</a>&nbsp; The weight
of this engine alone being 8.1 tons, the whole weight of itself,
and its tender, with the necessary supplies of fuel and water,
will not be less than twelve tons.&nbsp; Therefore, the friction
of the engines (and their tenders) requisite to carry these 4000
tons at the rate of 20 miles an hour, would be 4267 lbs.</p>
<p>The friction of one mile of air in a tunnel eight feet in
diameter, when moved at the rate of 20 miles an hour by
<i>exhaustion</i> being 288lbs., the friction of it in a tunnel
extending from Liverpool to Manchester, will be 8640lbs.: which,
though double the friction of these locomotive engines, might be
far cheaper for the following reason; and independent of the
circumstance, that I could lay down a tunnel capable of carrying
all these 4000 tons at one and the same time, from Liverpool to
Manchester, for one-fourth of what that railway has cost; <a
name="citation38b"></a><a href="#footnote38b"
class="citation">[38b]</a> and also independent of the
circumstance that the enormous expense now incurred for the
repairs of the locomotives (as stated on page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page11">11</a></span>) would also
be saved.</p>
<p>It is well known that the smaller a steam-engine is, the
larger is the proportionate quantity of fuel it requires, and the
greater the proportionate expense of working it; while it is
equally well known that, owing to the imperative importance of
lightness and efficiency over economy in locomotive engines, this
disadvantage increases in a most rapid ratio with respect to
them.&nbsp; In consequence of this, a quantity of fuel, which, in
large stationary engines, such as I should use for exhausting air
from the tunnel, would do a given quantity of work, would, in the
best of the locomotives on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway,
do only one-sixteenth as much work.</p>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>Therefore it results, that, notwithstanding the friction
of the air in a tunnel 30 miles long would, at the rate of 20
miles an hour, be twice as much as the friction of the locomotive
engines, yet, owing to the fuel consumed by the latter, to move
themselves and their tenders, being sixteen times as great as
large stationary engines, such as I should use, would require to
do the same work, the tunnel would, supposing the whole quantity
of goods were to be carried at once, be eight times the cheapest
mean of conveyance, in point of current expenses only, and
without reference to its first cost being only one-fourth that of
the railway; and also without reference to the whole of the
enormous expense now occasioned by the repairs of the locomotive
engines being saved.</p>
<p>But this is not the only proportion in which a tunnel might be
cheaper.&nbsp; The 13th paragraph of the Russian Engineer
Officer&rsquo;s Report, states, that he is &ldquo;convinced that
exhaustion to a degree which should give a pressure of fifteen
inches of mercury may be effected in the tunnel.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now, notwithstanding that much more than this may be done in an
iron tunnel, yet will I calculate on this only.&nbsp; Fifteen
inches of mercury being 7.3 lbs. that pressure on the area of the
tunnel, would move above twice the 4000 tons which the Directors
of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway estimated would be
carried from one to the other of those places every day; which,
supposing that weight to be conveyed at one time, would reduce
the expense (per ton of goods carried) of overcoming the friction
of air moving in a tunnel from Liverpool to Manchester, at the
rate of 20 miles an hour, to one-sixteenth of what the power
required to overcome the friction of the locomotive engines
required to draw the same weight would cost.</p>
<p>And though, owing to its being a received opinion that the
power required to overcome the friction of fluids increases
according to the square of the velocity, we are to suppose that
at 40 miles an hour, the fuel required to overcome the friction
of the air would be one-fourth that of the locomotive engines,
while at 80 miles an hour it would be equal to that of the
engines, still would a quadruple velocity be attained, by the
expenditure of only an equal quantity of fuel.</p>
<p>The amount of the power required to overcome the friction of
the locomotive engines (and their tenders) necessary to carry
4000 tons weight from Liverpool to Manchester daily, at the rate
of 20 miles an hour, is, when expressed in &ldquo;horse&rsquo;
power&rdquo; equal to the power of 225 horses working for an hour
and a half.&nbsp; In other words, these locomotives must exert
power to this amount, beyond what is required to draw the 4000
tons weight.</p>
<p>The power required to overcome the friction of air, which was
moving (by exhaustion) at the rate of 20 miles an hour, in a
tunnel of eight feet diameter, extending from Liverpool to
Manchester, would be equal to that of 456 horses: which, though
double the preceding, would yet be eight times cheaper, owing to
large stationary engines, such as I should use, requiring only
one-sixteenth part of the fuel required by locomotives to do
equal work.</p>
<p>At 40 miles an hour (supposing locomotives could go so fast)
the number of horses&rsquo; power required to overcome the
friction of the air in the tunnel would (according to the
received opinion of that friction increasing to the square of the
velocity) be 3650: which, though sixteen times greater than that
of the locomotive engines and their tenders, yet, in consequence
of this power being exerted only for three-quarters of an hour,
instead of an hour and a half, and of fuel doing sixteen times as
much work in large stationary engines as in locomotives, would be
only half so expensive as the locomotives and their tenders would
prove.</p>
<p>At 80 miles an hour (which is twice as fast as locomotives can
go) the power required <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>to overcome the friction of the air
in the tunnel, would (on the calculation that it increases
according to the square of the velocity) be equal to that of
29,196 horses; which is nearly 130 times as much as the
locomotive engines would require: though, owing to this power
operating only 22&frac12; minutes, instead of an hour and a half,
and to fuel in large stationary engines doing sixteen times as
much work as in locomotives, the expense would be only twice as
great as in the locomotives, exclusive of the whole of the most
enormous expense now incurred, by the repairs of the locomotives
being saved (which would, alone, more than make up the
difference) and also exclusive of the tunnel costing only one
quarter of what the railway has cost, and of the rate of
conveyance being four times as fast.</p>
<p>But it is not with respect to a tunnel only, that the
resistance of the air opposes an impediment: this resistance
being found so serious an obstacle to the progress of the
locomotive engines and their loads, that in all trials of, or
experiments with them, the state and direction of the wind is
noted and allowed for.&nbsp; In the &ldquo;Account of the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway,&rdquo; published by the
Treasurer of that Company (H. Booth, Esq.), he says:
&ldquo;Moreover, at great velocities, the resistance of the air
must not be left out of the calculation.&nbsp; At ten miles per
hour, it has been found by experiment, that the resistance of the
atmosphere is about half a pound weight on a square foot of flat
surface; at fifteen miles, the resistance is 1lb. per square
foot; and at twenty miles, about 2lbs. per square foot: the
increased resistance being, nearly, as the squares of the
velocities.&rdquo; <a name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a></p>
<p>The surface opposed to the air by a steam-coach, the engines
of which its proprietor told me were equal to ten horses power, I
found to be 30 square feet.&nbsp; That, opposed by another, the
engines of which were said to be equal to twenty horses power, I
found to be above 50 square feet: while, when carrying four
outsides on the front of the roof, this coach exposed nearly 70
square feet to the action of the air.&nbsp; The surface opposed
to the air by the large locomotive engines now used on the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway, I understand (when chimney,
axle-tree, wheels, and every thing that cuts the air, is taken
into account) to be about 40 feet square.&nbsp; Supposing it to
be so, at 20 miles an hour, the air will oppose resistance equal
to 80lbs. to the progress of the engine; which resistance having
to be overcome at the rate of 1760 feet per minute, is equal to
4&frac14; horses power.&nbsp; At 40 miles an hour, this
resistance would be 320lbs.; which resistance having to be
overcome at the rate of 3526 feet per minute, would be equal to
34 horses power.&nbsp; At 80 miles an hour, the resistance of the
air would be 1280lbs.; which resistance, having to be overcome at
the rate of 7,040 feet per minute, would be equal to 270 horses
power; while at 100, and 120 miles an hour, the power required
would be, respectively, that of 528 and 912 horses.</p>
<p>Now, as the force required at 80 miles an hour, is a
<i>few</i> times more than the whole power of those engines, and
as Dr. Hutton found that giving the moving body the form of a
cone, the height of which equalled the diameter of its base,
diminished the resistance of the air only half, it may serve to
shew that the statements of those who have given currency to the
opinion that we may be conveyed at <i>any</i> velocity on
railways, are promulgated by persons who pronounce upon questions
without examining them: since, in addition to this resistance of
the <i>air</i> to the locomotive engines themselves, would be its
resistance to the tenders, and coaches or waggons they drew; <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>and that,
too, independent of, and additional to, the resistance opposed by
the <i>railway</i> friction of the engines, tenders, and loads,
behind them.</p>
<p>That something of this kind prevents <i>very</i> high
velocities from being attained on railways, is evident.&nbsp; At
the locomotive engine competition on the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway four years ago, velocities of from 35 to 40 miles an
hour, were attained by engines which were not one-tenth the power
of some of those now used; while, at the opening of that railway,
three years ago, the engine by which the surgeon was brought to
Mr. Huskisson, after his deplorable accident, went 15 miles in 25
minutes, which is at the rate of 36 miles an hour.&nbsp; Yet do
not the so much more powerful locomotives now used on that road,
go faster than this: a circumstance which may prove that the
limit to the velocity of railway conveyance, will arise from a
source not calculated on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; it may be observed, &ldquo;this objection
to the possibility of very high velocities on railways, is
counterbalanced by the dilemma in which you place yourself, by
supposing it to be possible that any such power as that of 29,196
horses, can, at one time, be made to operate on a tunnel; since,
as relates to practical application, it would prove &lsquo;an
impossible quantity.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inference I deny; and, when necessary, will disprove. <a
name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a>&nbsp; But the term I accept; and will
avail myself of, to shew that it is equally &ldquo;an impossible
quantity&rdquo; that even if a tunnel were ten times as long as
one between Manchester and Liverpool, the friction of air which
is caused to move in it, in consequence of exhaustion taking
place at the opposite end, can ever oppose an impediment such as
is here adverted to.</p>
<p>According to the opinion that the friction of the air would
increase as the square of the velocity, the friction of the
column of air, which, when moved by exhaustion at the rate of 20
miles an hour, in a tunnel eight feet diameter and a mile long,
was 288lbs., would, when moved at the rate of 80 miles an hour,
be 4608lbs.; which, on the whole area of the tunnel, would be
equal to 1.3 inches of mercury.&nbsp; Therefore, supposing that
at every mile of a tunnel extending from Liverpool to Manchester,
barometer tubes were to be inserted, the bottoms (or basin ends)
of which should be open to the atmosphere, and the tops open to
the inside of the tunnel, the mercury in each successive tube
would (reckoning <i>towards</i> the end at which the exhaustion
took place) rise 1.3 inches higher than that in the
preceding.</p>
<p>Now as 1.3&times;23 gives 30, while 1.3&times;30 gives 39, it
appears that at 23 miles from that end of the tunnel at which the
atmosphere was admitted, and seven from that where the exhaustion
took place, there would be such a vacuum as would raise mercury
the <i>whole</i> height of the barometric column; while, at the
end of the 30 miles there would be&mdash;or rather <i>ought</i>
to be, according to this calculation&mdash;39 inches of mercury;
or a vacuum and a third; which, in addition to its being
&ldquo;an impossible quantity,&rdquo; places those who contend
that the resistance of the friction of air which is caused to
move through a tunnel by the pressure of the atmosphere in
consequence of exhaustion taking place at the opposite end,
increases according to the square of the velocity, in the dilemma
of assuming that there is a certain place in a tunnel 30 miles
long, where, notwithstanding that a <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>man, a horse, or even an elephant,
might walk as freely and unobstructedly along, as a mouse could
through a rat-hole, that subtle, permeating, and all-pervading
element which we breathe, would, like the stream of the Jordan
when under the influence of the miracle by which the Israelites
passed over that river, stop, stick fast, and be unable to move
farther; a position, which necessarily throws us for an escape
from this dilemma, on the conclusion that, though it is certain
that the friction of air against the inside of the tunnel will be
an impediment, and though it is probable that this impediment
will be of some importance, yet must it be equally certain that
it will not be the serious impediment which it is <i>supposed</i>
it will prove: and it may therefore, safely be assumed, that the
objection which presents an insuperable obstacle in the minds of
the many who have condemned the method of operation by exhaustion
which I propose (because they deemed it analogous to operating
per plenum) becomes removed, and is found to be what all the
other &ldquo;insuperable objections&rdquo; which have been
arrayed against the proposition are found to be when grappled
with; i.e. baseless and unreal: it being necessary only to put a
valve at every half, or quarter of a mile, which should be opened
by the carriages as they passed, to render the length of the
column of air of the natural density, which <i>must</i> be behind
the carriages to drive them along, only a few hundred yards, and
its friction consequently unimportant; said valves being (as can
easily be done) so arranged, as to close themselves again the
moment the carriage had arrived at, opened, and passed by, the
next succeeding one.</p>
<p>But though I freely admit that the friction of the air against
the inside of the tunnel may waste power to a degree which shall
prove not unimportant, yet may it be doubted whether it will be
more important than the waste of power occasioned by the present
method of railway transmission by locomotive engines.</p>
<p>In the documents laid before the Lords&rsquo; Committees on
the London and Birmingham Railway, by the Treasurer of the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway, on the 28th June, 1832, it is
stated that the &ldquo;number of trips of thirty miles&rdquo;
performed (or travelled) by the locomotive engines between
Liverpool and Manchester, in the half year ending the 31st
December, 1831, was &ldquo;5392&rdquo;: which, as the same
document shews that the <i>whole</i> amount of profitable weight
conveyed over those 30 miles during that half year was less than
91,000 tons, gives an average of only 17 tons as the profitable
weight carried each &ldquo;trip.&rdquo;&nbsp; The weight of the
engines by which these loads were drawn it may be difficult to
fix upon: though, as the locomotives now used on that railway,
are, some of them, above six tons, others above eight, and others
above ten tons in weight, it may, perhaps, be fair to take eight
tons as the average weight.&nbsp; The weight of the tenders with
fuel and water, appears to be rather a delicate subject.&nbsp;
The weight of the tender of the Rocket, with its load of fuel and
water, at the grand locomotive engine competition in October,
1829, was three-fourths that of the engine itself.&nbsp; There
have since been many accounts of immense loads drawn on the
railway, of which those by Dr. Lardner, in his &ldquo;Lectures on
the Steam Engine,&rdquo; are considered as &ldquo;by
authority.&rdquo;&nbsp; But though we find the weights of the
engines, as well as of the loads, and various other particulars
(even to the state of the wind) given, yet does it happen that
the weights of the tenders, with their supplies of fuel and
water, are &ldquo;unascertained&rdquo; and omitted,
throughout.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, I can do no other
than act on the best information I have obtained, and suppose the
weight of the engines and tenders with their cargoes of fuel and
water to be twelve tons for each &ldquo;trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Assuming it to be so, the weight of the moving power will be
above two-thirds of the profitable <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>weight conveyed; while, supposing the
same proportion to obtain as to the 4000 tons just mentioned, the
amount of the effect of the friction of the power by which they
were conveyed at the rate of 20 miles an hour, would be twice and
a half as much as the friction of the air would be in a tunnel
when twice the tonnage was conveyed from Liverpool to Manchester
in it, at the same rate; which, for equal quantities, is five
times the friction while, as relates to the fuel consumed, it
would be <i>very</i> many more times than this, dearer.</p>
<p>There is one class, who, above all others, might derive
benefit from properly considering what I thus submit, relative to
the friction of the air.</p>
<p>When what was termed &ldquo;the railway mania&rdquo; was at
its height, it was calculated that no body of men would be so
much benefited by it as the iron trade; in proof of which the
following statement was circulated:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are authorised to state, that the
rail-roads already projected, will require considerably more than
two millions of tons of iron.&nbsp; Now, as iron has recently
advanced from 7<i>l.</i> to 14<i>l.</i> per ton, it appears that
the iron masters (by the way, the originators of, or principals
in, many of these schemes) will receive from the subscribers
twenty-eight millions sterling.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, instead of the iron trade having been benefited by the
principal portion of what is expended on railways being for their
article, scarcely more than one-twentieth-part has been expended
for iron; the remainder having gone for labour in &ldquo;cutting
and embanking,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>In the account in Mr. Treasurer Booth&rsquo;s book, of the
expenses of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the line which,
in the statement, runs &ldquo;Iron rail account,&rdquo; gives
only 66,830<i>l.</i> as paid to the iron masters: the other
hundreds, which make up the aggregate of 67,912<i>l.</i> there
mentioned, being for &ldquo;oak plugs, freights, und
cartages;&rdquo; which is little more than one-twentieth part of
the whole that has been expended on this railway.</p>
<p>The rails of the London and Birmingham Railway are to be half
as heavy again as those of the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway.&nbsp; Yet does the expense of the &ldquo;rails, chairs,
keys, and pins,&rdquo; in the estimate of that railway laid
before Parliament, amount to only 212,940: one twelfth, that is,
of the two millions and a half, which form the aggregate of the
estimate there given in.</p>
<p>One of the inducements which railway advocates have held out
to the landed proprietors of the Houses of Parliament, in order
to lead them to support railway bills, has been the degree to
which poor rates, &amp;c. would be diminished, in consequence of
the labourers there would be employed in digging out the earth
for the cuttings and embankments, in the different parishes
through which the lines of railway would run; and in the papers
of the end of June and the beginning of July (1832) is a
<i>very</i> long advertisement of the London and Birmingham
Railway Company, one part of which states that &ldquo;The
<i>landed interest</i> will be benefitted by the expenditure of
<i>upwards</i> of two millions of the capital of the Company in
labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to their own shewing, therefore, the expenditure for
the benefit of the landed interest will be &ldquo;<i>upwards</i>
of two millions,&rdquo; while the cost of the iron rails, &amp;c.
will be only upwards of two hundred thousand pounds.&nbsp; And as
both this, and other advertisements, and the evidence before
Parliament, announce the extension of the railway from Birmingham
to Liverpool, when this first half of it from London to
Birmingham is done&mdash;which extension will be about the same
length as this first half&mdash;the statements of the railway
advocates themselves, give the iron masters to see, that the
result of the time, trouble, and expense, which they (the iron
masters) have devoted to <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>bring forward railways, is, to put
more than a shilling into the pockets of the agricultural
interest (by the degree to which they will save parish rates,
&amp;c. &amp;c.) for every farthing they put into the pockets of
the iron masters themselves; all that is saved to country
parishes, being actual gain to the agricultural interest; while
the 12th or 16th paid to the iron trade is for value in iron; out
of which the usual trade profit is all that the iron masters will
gain.&nbsp; In other words, about four millions sterling will be
paid <i>for</i> the parishes between London and Liverpool, in the
shape of wages for labourers, while only about four hundred
thousand pounds will be paid <i>to</i> the iron masters for the
iron rails, &amp;c.; out of which the iron masters will have to
pay the wages of their men who smelt &amp;c. the iron, and the
royalties (or rent) for the ore, coal, &amp;c. &amp;c. used in
making it.</p>
<p>The difference there is in the specific gravities of ore,
coal, and limestone, in different places, will render any
estimate <i>not</i> correct for every place; though, generally
speaking, I believe it may be received that the quantity of iron
stone, coal, and lime stone, which it is necessary to raise to
produce a ton of pig iron, will be about 6&frac12; cubic
yards.</p>
<p>In the evidence laid before the Lords&rsquo; Committees upon
the London and Birmingham Railway, it is stated that the whole
amount of &ldquo;earth work&rdquo; required for that railway,
amounts to 22,779,431 cubic yards; of which a detailed statement
is given in the minutes of evidence.</p>
<p>Dividing the twenty-three (nearly) millions of cubic yards of
&ldquo;earth work&rdquo; which are to be excavated and embanked
on the Birmingham Railway, by the number of cubic yards of ore,
&amp;c. which it is necessary to dig to make a ton of iron, will
show, that if the wages which will be paid for levelling on that
railway, were to be expended in digging iron ore, &amp;c. the
nation would be benefitted by having three millions and a half
tons of iron more than it now possesses; while the labour
expended on the railway will be not only worth nothing to the
nation, but also worse; insomuch as it appears by the evidence
before the Lords&rsquo; Committees that it will render 1250 acres
of land, which are now cultivated and productive, sterile as a
turnpike road.</p>
<p>It is supposed by Mr. Treasurer Booth, in his book on the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway, that three thousand miles of
rail-road, will, eventually, be laid down in England.</p>
<p>Supposing these 3000 miles to require &ldquo;earth work&rdquo;
(cuttings and embankments, i.e.) in the same proportion that the
London and Birmingham Railway will do so, and also supposing that
the wages which will be paid to the Irish, &amp;c. labourers, who
do the digging for this &ldquo;earth work,&rdquo; were, instead,
to be paid to the workmen of the iron masters for raising ore,
&amp;c. &amp;c. and converting it into iron, the nation would be
richer by nearly one hundred million tons of iron, than it will
be if these said wages are paid merely for &ldquo;cutting and
embanking&rdquo; for railways.</p>
<p>Now though I do not mean to insinuate that this hundred
million tons of metallic worth, would increase what is now termed
the &ldquo;monetary wealth&rdquo; of the nation, yet, as surely
as their ignorance (and consequent want) of iron, rendered Mexico
and Peru such easy conquests to the iron of the Spaniards, as to
make them most striking examples of the truth of Solon&rsquo;s
warning to Cr&oelig;sus, &ldquo;He who has more iron, will soon
be master of all this gold,&rdquo; so surely would the possession
of this hundred million tons of iron, be enormously more
advantageous to the nation, than the cuttings and embankments
required for these 3000 miles of railway will be.</p>
<p>Although iron be not, at the present day, either with
ourselves, or in any other part of the world, the symbol of
value, medium of exchange, and <i>money</i>, which Lycurgus made
it in Sparta, when that state was in her glory, yet has it, as a
commodity which will obtain us the gold and <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>silver of
Mexico and Peru in exchange for it, a value, which will procure
us the amount of its worth in those metals, as certainly as any
other commodity that we export.&nbsp; In whatever proportion,
therefore, this hundred million tons of iron would procure us
either the gold or silver, the corn and flour, the silks and
cottons, the wines and wools, the tea and coffee, the sugar and
spices, &amp;c. &amp;c. of other countries, would devoting the
wages which will be expended in cutting and embanking for these
3000 miles of railway, to the raising and smelting of iron ore,
be more valuable to the nation at large, than if so employed.</p>
<p>Nor is this all; since the substitute I propose for railways,
would give us food for one hundred thousand people, which these
railways will deprive us of.</p>
<p>The documents laid before the Lords&rsquo; Committees, state,
that this Birmingham railway will cover and throw out of
cultivation, 1250 acres of land.&nbsp; Supposing the proportion
thrown out by the 3000 miles of railway to be the same, the whole
amount will be 33,333 acres.&nbsp; Allowing these acres to
produce three quarters of corn each, is no very excessive
allowance. <a name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a>&nbsp; And each individual of the
kingdom being estimated to consume a quarter of corn every year,
here is land that would produce bread for one hundred thousand
people thrown out of cultivation by the railway system.</p>
<p>Now as, in addition to its being perfectly <i>practicable</i>
for my tunnels to be buried underground, it would be decidedly
best for themselves, and for the operation of the principle, that
they should be so; and as ploughing, sowing, reaping, mowing, and
all other operations of agriculture, may go on over them, as over
any drain, or water-pipe, there is, in addition to the
<i>metallic</i> difference which my plan would make to the riches
of the nation, the circumstance, that, besides providing this
exchangeable metallic wealth, or exportable value, it would also
provide us, every year, with food for one hundred thousand more
people, than the railway system can provide for.</p>
<p>The <i>metallic</i> part of the question being, however, that
which concerns the iron trade, I will keep to that.</p>
<p>One of my early views of this method of conveyance, was, that
it <i>might</i> prove important to the iron trade, from the much
greater quantity of their production which it would consume, than
railways require: and it has, for these seven years, been an
object with me, to awaken the attention of the iron masters to
(as I conceived) its importance to them, and to endeavour to
convince them of the propriety of giving to a plan, which would
consume <i>tons</i> of their article, where railways consume only
hundred weights, the same fostering and support which they gave
to bringing forward railways.</p>
<p>But it has not pleased the iron masters to see the case in the
same light in which it presented itself to me.</p>
<p>It is well known to them, that in the year 1810 we had neither
a steam-vessel nor a gas-work in the kingdom: the propositions to
adopt both those important inventions being <i>then</i> termed
and treated, just as this proposition of mine is now termed and
treated, i.e. as &ldquo;impossible, absurd, and madness to think
of.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet have they seen that a sum of (roundly
speaking) ten millions, has, since that period, been sunk in the
construction of gas-works and steam-vessels.</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>With
proofs such as these before them (and which have led to the
consumption of so much of their production as gas-works and mains
require), that, what they, a few years ago, deemed utterly
impossible, may, nevertheless, be quite the reverse&mdash;it
might have been supposed that the iron masters would not prove,
either incredulous to, or bigoted against, the belief that a
still more important extension of the use of their article was
about to open to them.</p>
<p>But, to my great surprise, I have found, that of all
unbelievers, the iron masters have proved the most
unbelieving.</p>
<p>Other people doubted only because the want of knowledge on the
subject, which they openly avowed, left them no
alternative.&nbsp; But, in the iron masters, I have had &ldquo;to
contend with the pride of false knowledge.&rdquo;&nbsp; The world
at large said, &ldquo;We cannot believe, because we cannot
understand.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the iron masters say, &ldquo;We do
not believe, because <i>we</i> know better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On asking them how and why they &ldquo;knew better,&rdquo; I
found that it was not, as some might suppose, from any doubt or
difficulty as to the tunnel itself; which they admitted could be
cast and laid down, of any size or dimensions that might be
required.&nbsp; Neither was it from any doubt as to steam-engines
or air-pumps being large and powerful enough to do what was
necessary;&mdash;the tens of thousands of gallons of air ejected
per minute, from the air-pumps which they use to blow the fires
of their smelting-furnaces, and the hundreds of horses power they
know steam-engines are made equal to, removing all question on
these points. <a name="citation46"></a><a href="#footnote46"
class="citation">[46]</a>&nbsp; But their incredulity arose from
a difficulty which one of them had met with, in forcing air
through a pipe; and of which they supposed me ignorant; but to
which I had adverted, in a publication years before, in the
following words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is too well known, to be at all affected
in point of veracity, by an inability to mention either the exact
time or place, that the proprietor of an iron work in Wales had,
some years ago, occasion to erect an additional furnace, at the
distance (recollection states) of about three-quarters of a mile
from his old ones.&nbsp; The blast apparatus of these old works
being large enough to supply this new furnace in addition to the
old ones, he conceived it would prove much cheaper, if, instead
of having power and blast cylinders erected at the new work, he
were to lay a pipe from the old ones, to convey to the new one
the superfluous blast.&nbsp; This he accordingly did; and as soon
as the pipe was completed, set the apparatus going, to ascertain
the strength of the blast he could thus apply to the new
furnace.&nbsp; To his great surprise, however, no blast was
produced; a gentle current, which would hardly blow a candle out,
being all that was perceptible.&nbsp; For a result so adverse to
his expectation, he could account in no way but by supposing
that, from accident or design, the pipe was stopped up.&nbsp; As
the readiest way to ascertain whether it was so, he put a cat in
at one end, and blocked it up, leaving her to find her way to the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus situated, puss had no alternative but that of
seeking an exit at the other end: this she accordingly did, and,
contrary to his expectations, soon made her appearance
there.&nbsp; Convinced <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>by this that the pipe was not stopped
up, he concluded that the disappointment he had experienced arose
from the friction of the air against it; and finding that he
could in no way obviate this difficulty, he was obliged to
abandon the design, and be at the additional expense of blast
apparatus for his new furnace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, had the proposition this treatise submits, been,
that we should convey ourselves through a tunnel such as has been
adverted to, by employing apparatus on the principle of blast
furnaces, to blow us through, by <i>forcing</i> air in behind us,
the circumstance which has just been stated would be fatal to
that proposition.&nbsp; But when, instead of being blown through,
by air <i>forced</i> in behind us, it is proposed to cause the
air which is behind the vehicle to operate to push it forward, in
consequence of some being taken from before it, the case is
widely different.&nbsp; Air which is forced to move in a pipe, in
consequence of other air being driven into that pipe behind it,
operates (in degree) as a wedge, and opposes to the power which
moves it, resistance, arising from becoming, as it were, wedged
against the pipe, through its whole length.&nbsp; But air which,
instead of being <i>forced</i> to move by an impulse from behind,
that, as it were, wedges it against even the very end of the pipe
it enters at, is <i>allowed</i> to move, owing to some being
taken out from before it instead of being forced in behind it,
becomes affected as any thing from which a wedge is
<i>withdrawn</i> is affected; that is, freedom of motion is
allowed, and its parts play so much more freely, that friction is
diminished instead of increased.&nbsp; The impediment would
prove, therefore, less important in this case than in the other,
even were there no method of altogether obviating it; happily,
however, the means of doing this are in our power.&nbsp; Between
driving a vehicle through the proposed tunnel by forcing air in
behind it, and according to the method which has been stated,
there is this difference,&mdash;that in the former case the
impulse can be given only from the end where the moving power
operates; while, in the latter, arranging valves, which should be
opened by the vehicle as it passed over them, would admit of that
impulse being renewed at every hundred yards, could it be
necessary to do it so frequently.&nbsp; Let the friction of the
air against the pipe be what it may, therefore, a valve at every
mile, or at every half or quarter of a mile, which (as may be
done) should be opened by the vehicle as it passed along, and
caused to remain open till it (the vehicle) had arrived at the
next valve, would prevent any diminution of the velocity at which
we might be conveyed, that would prove important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This reasoning may be illustrated by a figure relating
to an experiment.&nbsp; Air was forced through a pipe 56 feet
long, at the rate of 20 miles an hour, under a pressure which is
equal to 2.2 inches of water; and as it required a pressure which
is equal to 0.6 inches of water to make air move at that rate
through a hole in the side of a vessel, there was consequently
1.6 inches greater pressure at that end of the pipe at which the
air entered, than at the end from whence it issued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now if the length of the pipe&mdash;the tenths of
pressure at the entering&mdash;and those at the issuing end, be
expressed by two lines approximating each other, as shewn below,
it may be conceived how &lsquo;air which is forced to move in a
pipe in consequence of other air being driven into that pipe
behind it, operates as a wedge; and opposes to the power which
moves it, resistance, arising from becoming as it were wedged
against the pipe, through its whole length.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p47.jpg">
<img alt=
"Two lines illustrating the above point"
title=
"Two lines illustrating the above point"
 src="images/p47.jpg" />
</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Since the length of these two lines bears
the same proportion in hundredths of an inch to 56 feet, as the
spaces between the ends of them bear (in tenths of an inch) to
2.2 inches of water, and <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>0.6 inches of water; <a
name="citation48a"></a><a href="#footnote48a"
class="citation">[48a]</a> and if we conceive that forcing air to
move in this way, is, in some degree, analogous to drawing an
elastic endless rope, the size of which should be equal to the
larger end of the pipe, through it, and out at the smaller end,
we may form some idea of the degree to which power would be
absorbed in operating by a plenum.&nbsp; And not only this;
since, reversing the operation, and supposing the rope to be
drawn from the smaller to the larger end, will also give us some
idea of the effect of operating by exhaustion, or vacuum; and
enable us to conceive that &lsquo;air which is allowed to move,
owing to some being taken out from before it, instead of being
forced in behind it, becomes affected, as any thing from which a
wedge is withdrawn is affected; that is, freedom of motion is
allowed, and its parts play so much more freely, that friction is
diminished instead of increased.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unconvinced, however, by arguments of this kind, the iron
masters persist in maintaining what I propose to be impossible,
because one of them found that the <i>exactly reverse</i> process
is so.&nbsp; In other words, they act just as those
&ldquo;impossibleists&rdquo; did, who, in their ignorance that
high steam would admit of the vacuum, air-pump, ponderous
condensing chest, and ton of cold water per horse power per hour,
which are inseparable from low-pressure engines, being dispensed
with in high-pressure engines, pronounced it to be utterly
impossible ever to make steam-engines capable of running upon
roads, because such engines could neither carry the ponderous
apparatus inseparable from the condenser, nor the immense
quantity of cold water required to produce the vacuum which,
alone, renders low-pressure engines efficient.</p>
<p>In vain did I point out to them, not only that I had not
overlooked their objection, but that my earliest views of the
subject, had adverted to, and expressly guarded against it.&nbsp;
It was of no use: for no &ldquo;Demetrius&rdquo; or other
&ldquo;craftsman&rdquo; of that day ever vociferated,
&ldquo;Great is Diana of the Ephesians!&rdquo; more
perseveringly, than the principal iron masters of the present day
have exclaimed in honour of the idol &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo;
whom it pleased them to set up and worship, in opposition to the
(as they deemed it) heresy I presumed to attempt to teach
them.</p>
<p>Had they done me the honour to <i>prove</i> me heretical, and
that theirs was the <i>true</i> faith, I should have been
importantly benefitted, as well as convinced: insomuch as it
would have prevented me from devoting at least seven additional
years of time, and all the means in my power during that period,
to the subject.&nbsp; But when they would not trouble themselves
to <i>examine</i>, and condemned, solely because they proclaimed
&ldquo;impossible,&rdquo; a method of operation, which I not only
did <i>not</i> advocate, but which my publications proved I had
long and openly disclaimed, I could not but feel, first, the
truth of Dr. Robertson&rsquo;s observation, &ldquo;As in Genoa
ignorance had opposed and disappointed Columbus, in Lisbon he had
to combat with prejudice, an enemy no less formidable;&rdquo;
and, secondly, that just as the reasoning of the pilot who was
chosen to execute the treachery planned against Columbus, failed,
because he had courage only to go half-way, so did the reasoning
of these gentlemen fail, because they have done only <i>half</i>
what is necessary to disprove the practicability of what I
propose. <a name="citation48b"></a><a href="#footnote48b"
class="citation">[48b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>In
publications, besides that just quoted, I have not only stated my
conviction that the method of operation which the iron masters
condemn would be impracticable, but also have endeavoured to
analyse the question, and show <i>why</i> it would be so.&nbsp;
But as I do not, like them, stop there, and (in effect) say that
it must ever be impossible to discover a &ldquo;North-West
Passage,&rdquo; or reach the <i>North</i> Pole, because Captain
Cook could not get within 30&deg; of the South Pole, these
gentlemen are pleased to act the part of &ldquo;Alexander the
coppersmith,&rdquo; against me, rather than to give themselves
the trouble of examining whether the part of another Alexander
might not prove more honourable, as well as more advantageous to
them.</p>
<p>The quotation given a few pages back, states that the price of
iron was raised from 7<i>l.</i> to 14<i>l.</i> in 1825, in
consequence of what was then called &ldquo;the railway
mania.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, so far from maintaining this price, the
following extract from a Memorial, which was agreed to at a
meeting of the Staffordshire Iron Trade, held at Dudley, on the
4th October, 1831, shews, that in six years the price of iron had
fallen lower than ever before was known.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Memorial to the
Right Honourable Earl Grey, First Lord of His Majesty&rsquo;s
Treasury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We, the undersigned Iron Masters, of the Staffordshire
Iron and Coal district, think it our duty respectfully to
represent to His Majesty&rsquo;s Government the following
facts:</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&nbsp; That for the last five years, ever <i>since
what is called the panic of</i> 1825, we have found, with very
slight intermissions, a continually increasing depression in the
prices of the products of industry, and more particularly in Pig
Iron and Bar Iron, which have fallen respectively from upwards of
8<i>l.</i> <i>per ton</i> to under 3<i>l.</i> <i>per ton</i>, and
from 15<i>l.</i> <i>per ton</i> to under 5<i>l.</i> <i>per
ton</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; Against this alarming and long-continued
depression, we have used every possible effort in our power to
make head.&nbsp; We have practised all manner of economy, and
have had recourse to every possible improvement in the working of
our mines and manufactories.&nbsp; <i>Our workmen&rsquo;s
wages</i> have, in many instances, been greatly reduced, and such
reduction has been attended with, and <i>effected by</i>, <i>very
great suffering and distress</i>:&mdash;but the royalties, rents,
contracts, and other engagements, under which we hold our
respective works and mines, have scarcely been reduced at all,
nor can we get them effectually reduced, <i>because the law
enforces their payment in full</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3.&nbsp; The prices of the products of our industry
having thus fallen within the range of the fixed charges and
expenses which the law compels us to discharge, the just and
necessary profits of our respective trades have ceased to exist:
and in many cases a positive loss attends them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, we have long
hesitated in determining what line of conduct our interest and
our duties require us to adopt:&mdash;If we should abandon our
respective trades, our large and expensive outlays in machinery
and erections must be sacrificed, at an enormous loss to
ourselves, and our honest and meritorious workmen must be thrown
in thousands upon parishes, already too much impoverished by
their present burdens, to support them:&mdash;and if we should
continue our respective trades, we see nothing but the prospect
of increasing distress, and certain ruin to all around
us.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remaining part of this &ldquo;Memorial&rdquo; touching on
politics, need not be quoted here.</p>
<p>If the iron of the 3000 miles of railway which Mr. Treasurer
Booth, in his book on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway
supposes may eventually be laid down in England, should be of the
same weight which I understand that of the Birmingham Railway is
to be, the whole quantity consumed will be about 800,000
tons.&nbsp; Supposing an equal application of the system here
advocated, and that only ten times as much iron should be used in
the tunnels as is used in the railways, eight millions of tons,
instead of eight hundred thousand, will be the aggregate
consumption.</p>
<p>Now as iron, though unquestionably the best, is neither the
only, nor the <i>cheapest</i> material of which tunnels can be
constructed, it may not, possibly, be unpardonably presumptuous
in me to submit to the iron masters, that if they persist in
doing, by this proposition, as the Genoese did by that of
Columbus, they will also lose an opportunity, which would, to
them, prove equally important, as would have been that of
Columbus to Genoa.</p>
<p>I <i>have</i> asked, and I <i>still</i> ask of them only one
thing: a full, and <i>fair</i> investigation.&nbsp; By the result
of that I am content to abide; though I must, in common justice
stipulate, that this investigation shall be entered on in a
different spirit to what it has hitherto been my lot to meet
with.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is always a proneness&rdquo; says
Washington Irving, &ldquo;to consider a man under examination as
a kind of delinquent, or impostor, whose faults and errors are to
be detected and exposed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Most truly can I say that I
have &ldquo;<i>always</i>&rdquo; experienced the effects of this
&ldquo;proneness&rdquo; in reference to this subject: and that
the object of those who deemed my proposition worthy throwing
away a fragment of their time upon, was infinitely less to
ascertain its truth and justice, than to display their own
penetration and wit, in discovering and turning to ridicule,
every part which admitted (as they thought) of being sneered at
and made the subject of a jest.</p>
<p>Had it been my good fortune to have met with but one candid
examinant of influence, I had been spared years of trouble and
anxiety.&nbsp; But my proposition being deemed deserving only of
<a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>contempt,
candid examination has no more been vouchsafed me, than to the
wanderings of a lunatic.</p>
<p>Should, however, the iron masters, instead of granting me this
candid investigation, continue, &ldquo;in the pride of half
knowledge,&rdquo; (as Dr. Wells terms it) to condemn what I
propose, because they have found that a something has failed,
which is as different from it, as would be, saying that it is
impossible we can ever get to the North Pole, because Captain
Cook could not get within 30&deg; of the <i>South</i>, I venture
to commit myself to the prediction that they will repent it, as
bitterly as Genoa repented her rejection of Columbus&rsquo;s
proposition, to discover, and possess her of America.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They inconsiderately rejected his proposal,
as the dream of a chimerical projector,&rdquo; says Dr.
Robertson, of the Genoese, &ldquo;and lost, for ever, the
opportunity of restoring their commonwealth to its ancient
splendour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For, equally certain as it is that iron, though the best, is
not the <i>only</i> material of which tunnels can be constructed,
is it, that unless this proposition is very differently treated
by them to what it has hitherto been, will they drive the
manufacturing of tunnels from their own line into another: and
that, too, notwithstanding that opportunities are arising which,
in addition to bringing them to their own doors, would give such
facilities as relates to the transmission of the large stocks of
iron which the uncertainty, and occasional long interruptions of
the present method of conveyance, compel them to keep in London,
as to do away with the necessity for keeping those stocks.</p>
<p>The Welch papers announce the plan of a railway which is to
connect the iron districts and ports of that country with
London.&nbsp; In this plan, Merthyr Tydvil, the centre of the
South Wales iron manufacture, is stated to be 176 miles from
London.</p>
<p>Now, even supposing that this railway, instead of costing the
<i>many</i> thousands per mile which it must cost, could be laid
down for nothing, still, the circumstance of the <i>bare
expenses</i> of conveyance on the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway, amounting to 4&frac14;<i>d.</i> per ton, per mile,
exclusive of the charges necessary to pay one farthing of
interest, or return on the capital sunk in laying that railway
down&mdash;and for which 3&frac34;<i>d.</i> per ton, per mile, is
charged, in addition to the 4&frac14;<i>d.</i> required to cover
the <i>bare expenses</i>&mdash;the mere <i>expenses</i> of
railway conveyance, <i>exclusive</i> of interest or return on the
capital invested, being so great as this, it appears that, even
were this railway laid from their own doors to the metropolis,
the iron masters could not, including the charge to pay interest
or return upon the money sunk in laying the railway down, get
their material to London for less than 4<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per
ton; which, on an article the selling price of which (pigs) in
London is only about the same amount, is in effect a prohibition;
especially with the expense of freight for coast conveyance, only
12<i>s.</i> per ton from South Wales to London.</p>
<p>But as the expense of carriage by a tunnel would be as much
less than this over-sea freight, as that is less than railway
conveyance; while, in addition to this superiority over both, a
tunnel would save all the <i>risk</i> as well as the delays and
uncertainty of over-sea transmission, London and the iron
districts might be brought within so few hours of each other, as
to obviate the necessity of the iron masters keeping the heavy
stocks of their article in London which they are now obliged to
maintain, and the capital so locked up become, in consequence,
liberated for other purposes: while, were the tunnel extended to
Milford Haven, as it has been announced the railway would be,
that port, as well as Swansea, might be brought within a few
hours of London; and the advantages <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>of its (perhaps) unequalled harbour,
rendered fully available to the nation at large for commercial
purposes, as well as to Government for our fleets.</p>
<p>This consideration merits the serious attention of the
advocates of the Bristol Railway.&nbsp; Swansea and Milford Haven
being <i>both</i> more advantageously situated for all vessels
from foreign ports that would make Bristol their port of
delivery; and their harbours being (particularly the latter)
incomparably superior to that of Bristol, a tunnel would, were it
to be laid down between either of them and the metropolis, be the
certain ruin of any <i>railway</i> from Bristol to London.&nbsp;
The mere <i>expenses</i> of carriage on the Liverpool and
Manchester Railway being 4&frac12;<i>d.</i> per ton per mile, and
the <i>whole</i> charge 8<i>d.</i>, it is evident that, supposing
the Bristol Railway were to cost only <i>half</i> what the
Liverpool and Manchester has cost (the &ldquo;Capital,
3,000,000<i>l.</i>&rdquo; placed at the head of the prospectus of
the Bristol Railway, allows 25,000<i>l.</i> per mile for each of
the 120 miles the map accompanying said prospectus shews the line
will be in length) the whole change for carriage along its line
could not be less than 6<i>d.</i> per ton per mile: the aggregate
of which, 3<i>l.</i>, would be equal to what cargoes have been
brought from the East Indies for; and more than equal to freights
from the West Indies, Mediterranean, &amp;c. &amp;c.; so that
only such cargoes or freights, as stress of weather drove into
Bristol, would be sent to London by the railway; while, by a
tunnel from Milford or Swansea, they might be sent so cheaply, as
actually to command the trade which it is <i>supposed</i> the
Bristol Railway will command.</p>
<p>But to return from the long digression, into which the
consideration of the question relative to the effect of the
friction of the air, and the importance of the subject to the
iron trade, has led me.</p>
<p>Supposing the possibility of the Liverpool and Manchester
railway proving a failure, that company would have scarcely any
more <i>saleable</i> value in their possession, in exchange for
the million and a quarter which it has already cost, and the
million and a half which it <i>will</i> cost them, than the
(about) 5000 tons of iron which is in their rails.&nbsp; Their
long, narrow, slip of ground, dear as it has been to them, would
be worth nothing; while the labour of taking up the between two
and three hundred thousand stone blocks (or bases) they have laid
down to carry the rails, would be more than those blocks are
worth.&nbsp; Also would the 450,000<i>l.</i> expended in
levelling the line <i>and forming the road</i>, be utterly lost.
<a name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52"
class="citation">[52]</a>&nbsp; Whereas, had a tunnel been laid
down, not only would the whole of the hundreds of thousands
expended in levelling have been saved, but as not one-tenth of
the labour would have been required to lay a tunnel down,
compared with what the railway required, a large sum would have
been saved for that also; while what <i>was</i> <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>laid out,
being for <i>metal</i>, instead of labour, there would have been
from ten to twenty times more saleable value in their hands, than
they now have.</p>
<p>And as the same circumstances would, in a similar case, apply
to the Birmingham, and Bristol (and indeed to <i>all</i>)
Railways, as well as to your line, it would, comparatively, be
almost as much better, in this particular, to have a tunnel
instead of a rail-road or canal, as it would be to hold specie
instead of paper, during a run on the bank: though this advantage
would be greatest in relation to a canal; the greater proportion
of the expense of which, is for that <i>irrecoverable</i> outlay,
labour.</p>
<p>In point of the friction of the wheels would the carriages
that moved in the tunnel be importantly superior to railway
carriages.</p>
<p>Owing to circumstances which it is not necessary to discuss,
the height of the wheels of the coaches and waggons on railways
is confined to about three feet.&nbsp; Wheels of twice that
diameter have been tried, but thrown aside in consequence of
their liability to cause accidents by running off the rails: the
only thing by which the wheels of all vehicles running on edge
railways are kept on them, being a rim, which, projecting <i>one
inch</i> beyond the bearing part of the tire of the wheels, keeps
them on the rails; as the brim of a hat will keep the body of it
from rising on a table, over the edge of which said brim
hangs.</p>
<p>In consequence of this, all carriages running on open railways
are liable to accidents, such as those mentioned in the notes
below, <i>many</i> of which have occurred; though, owing to their
having happened either in the excavations, on the levels, or on
the low embankments, the dashings-to-pieces which <i>will</i>
take place when they occur on the high embankments have,
hitherto, been avoided. <a name="citation53a"></a><a
href="#footnote53a" class="citation">[53a]</a></p>
<p>But as the carriages inside the tunnel <i>cannot</i> get off
the railway in it, as they do on common railways, while, owing to
the constantly vertical position in which the wheels can be kept,
they may be twice, or three times, as high as on common railways,
so great a diminution in the power required to move any load will
take place, as to admit of any weight being moved in the tunnel
with less than half the power required to move it on the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway.</p>
<p>In point of repairs, too, would the tunnel be importantly
cheaper than a railway.&nbsp; Supposing you were to have a
railway, there would be, in every mile of it, above seven
thousand stone blocks, or bases, to carry the rails; every one of
which bases would be liable to sink, and disarrange the <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>level of the
line, as they are so constantly doing (vide page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page11">11</a></span>); while the
rails themselves would be liable to bend, and break, between
these bases.&nbsp; Sinkings of the bases, and bendings and
breakings of the rails, &amp;c. &amp;c. being (like fractures of
the harness and apparatus of stage-coaches, or the ropes of
ships) matters of constant occurrence, there are, in the whole,
and including <i>every</i> liability to disarrangement and
repair, above eighty thousand parts or places, in every mile of
the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, where adjustment or repair
<i>may</i> daily be required; while, were that railway to be made
a quadruple one, by having two more lines of road (four more
lines of rails, i.e.) laid down, these liabilities would increase
to above one hundred and sixty thousand per mile; though, for the
present, I refer only to fractures and loosenings of the chairs,
&amp;c. bendings and breakings of the rails, and sinkings,
&amp;c. of the bases, which are <i>now</i> possible to the amount
of above 40,000 per mile; whereas, in a tunnel, the corresponding
disarrangements would be possible to the amount of only 1056 per
mile: an advantage which time will prove to be of much greater
importance than it may at first be considered; owing to the small
expense of repair it will occasion.&nbsp; Supposing the London
and Birmingham Railway were to have the &ldquo;quadruple
line&rdquo; adverted to when the capital was raised to three
millions, there would, in its whole length, be nearly twenty
millions of parts or places where repair, or adjustment,
<i>might</i>, daily, be necessary: a number which might well
double the 488<i>l.</i> per mile, per annum, charged under the
item &ldquo;Maintainance of way,&rdquo; in the half-yearly
accounts of the Liverpool and Manchester Railroad.</p>
<p>But neither is this the last circumstance with respect to
which a tunnel would be superior to a railway.</p>
<p>From the statements laid before Parliament, it appears that in
the half-year ending the 31st December, 1831, &ldquo;the number
of trips of 30 miles&rdquo; made on the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway was 5392.&nbsp; Now as the <i>whole</i> weight carried
during this half-year was <i>under</i> 91,000 tons, it appears
that the average <i>profitable</i> weight (passengers, or
merchandise) carried each trip, was <i>less</i> than 17 tons.</p>
<p>The average weight of an engine and its tender, with fuel and
water, being, I believe, not less than 12 tons, while there is
the weight of the coaches and waggons additional to this, it
would appear that for every ton which pays any thing, that is
carried on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, they also carry
a ton which pays nothing.</p>
<p>Now, owing to the manner in which the carriages that move in
the tunnel can be constructed, and owing to there being no
locomotive engines, and tenders carrying fuel and water, required
to move them, this proportion of dead and unprofitable weight
will be so much reduced, as for it not to amount to more than
one-fifth of the similar weight on the railway.</p>
<p>The <i>whole</i> expense of conveyance on the Liverpool and
Manchester Railway during the six months ending the 31st
December, 1831, was, it appears by the statement laid before the
Lords&rsquo; Committees on the London and Birmingham Railway
bill, fourpence farthing per ton, per mile; while the whole
<i>charge</i> for it was eightpence per ton, per mile.&nbsp; Coal
being nearly ten times dearer here than it is there, there is no
reason to suppose that what it might cost you for conveyance
along a line of railway would be less than this; while it may be
presumed that it would be so much more as, perhaps, and of
itself, totally to counteract the advantages afforded by the
shortness of your line, compared with the present route.</p>
<p>In addition to the advantages which I have stated a tunnel
would hold out to the Company I <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>have the honour to address, there
would be one of a peculiar nature.&nbsp; It is generally
understood, and appears from evidence to be the fact, that a
considerable portion of the income of the Liverpool and
Manchester Railway Company has arisen from persons who have
visited and paid for riding over their line, solely from
curiosity; while it is well known that the income derived from
visitors to their tunnel, by the Thames Tunnel Company, is
considerable; the average annual amount having been 1200<i>l.</i>
per annum.</p>
<p>The curiosity excited by the public relative to the tunnel I
constructed at Brighton, surprised me.&nbsp; Thousands manifested
a desire to see it: hundreds applied to be permitted to do so;
and when they found I would not let them, offered guinea after
guinea to be allowed to gratify their curiosity, under the idea
that mercenary motives gave rise to the orders I left that <i>no
one</i> should be admitted; while many of the very highest rank
(including <i>every</i> class of our nobility) made personal
application to me to oblige them with a sight of it.</p>
<p>As I could convey persons in your tunnel (supposing you were
to have one) most safely at the rate of a mile in a minute, and
as a velocity of that kind being attained near the metropolis, by
a method so novel as this, would induce very many thousands to
visit and ride through it for curiosity, it may be expected that
a considerable part of what it would cost to lay a tunnel down
would be returned from this source; enough (in the end) I am bold
to say, to pay for the cost of the iron whereof it would be
constructed.</p>
<p>The Thames Tunnel, supposing it never should be completed,
will for years bring in the 1200<i>l.</i> per annum, which is the
average of what has been received from people visiting it; and I
am fully satisfied that proper measures would, in the end, bring
in, from this source alone, perhaps, more than would cover the
coat of the iron, of which the tunnel I propose to you would be
constructed.</p>
<p>In the prospectus of the Greenwich Railway Company is the
following paragraph:&mdash;&ldquo;Moreover, when it is considered
that the population of London, Westminster, and the Borough, is
about one million and a half, and that the population of the
surrounding towns and villages, within a circuit of from forty to
fifty miles round the Capital, amounts to nearly double that
number; and that, in short, the number of persons visiting London
during each year, make up a total exceeding five millions of
persons, it is not unreasonable to expect that, through mere
curiosity alone, two millions of persons will gratify the same,
when it can be accomplished at a low price, suppose only one
shilling, to go and return,&mdash;yet if so, that item alone
would produce 100,000<i>l.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, as supposing that the curiosity excited by my
<i>novel</i> proposition, will produce only one quarter of what
the Greenwich Railroad Company calculate may come into their
pockets from the same source, will, I think, be allowing
sufficient pre-eminence to the <i>superior</i> curiosity which an
old method of conveyance <i>must</i> excite, I trust that my
idea, that the cost of the iron composing the tunnel may be
repaid from this source, will be considered a not immoderate
one.</p>
<p>In the Thames Tunnel there is nothing but the bare arch to
see; while in this there would be the tunnel itself, the largest
air-pumps, &amp;c. &amp;c. in the world, and a ride to and fro at
the rate of sixty, or more, miles an hour.</p>
<p>Nor would the objection which, it may be imagined, must arise
from the want of daylight in the tunnel, prove an objection in
point of fact.&nbsp; So trifling is the degree of exhaustion and
pressure required to move a load of 100 tons, that, but that the
advantages which would arise, as relates to cheapness of site,
and evasion of opposition on the part of the land-owners and
occupiers, from <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>carrying the tunnel under ground, prevent it, I could
window light the tunnel throughout its whole, length: that which
I constructed at Brighton having light admitted into it through
windows of common thin glass; strong plate-glass not being
required.&nbsp; Indeed, so far as relates to possibility, the
upper half of the tunnel might be one continued window (like the
top of a green-house), throughout its whole length.&nbsp; But as,
even if this was done, artificial light <i>must</i> be had for
sixteen hours out of the twenty-four in the winter; as the tunnel
might be gas-lighted throughout its whole length; or as, instead
of thus wasting light unnecessarily, each carriage might carry
lights before and behind, the objection that the tunnel being
underground would render it dark as midnight, is no more a
serious objection than it would be, were the Thames tunnel
finished, that it would be better to cross the river by London
Bridge, than through that tunnel, because on the bridge you would
have <i>natural</i>, while in the tunnel you must have artificial
light.</p>
<p>It is true that there could be no &ldquo;view of the
country&rdquo; by this method of conveyance.&nbsp; But, as the
object of it is the perfection of travelling, in the three
particulars of safety, expedition, and economy; as even the
comparatively low rates attained on the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway prevent objects that are by the road-side being
distinctly seen, owing to the velocity with which the passengers
are whirled by them; and as the much greater velocity at which
conveyance may be effected in the tunnel, would render any
attempt to look on what was <i>passed</i> productive of the
effects experienced by a child who looks on the ground while
leaning out of the window of a coach, no <i>real</i> loss, as
relates to &ldquo;seeing the country,&rdquo; would result from
transmission taking place inside the tunnel instead of outside
it: though, even if it should, it might be submitted to, when
economy of both time and money, and complete obviation of the
dangers attendant on breaking down, being overturned, run away
with, or driven against any thing, became the equivalents.</p>
<p>Have we occasion to travel to Edinburgh by the mail, we
unrepiningly submit to the inconvenience of passing two nights
(32 hours in mid winter) not only in total darkness, but also
&ldquo;cabinned, cribbed, confined&rdquo; to a degree which
prevents us even from &ldquo;changing a leg,&rdquo; except by
previous arrangement with our opposite fellow-passenger.&nbsp;
But when it is proposed that we shall go in vehicles which, in
addition to being as large and commodious as the cabins of many
steam-vessels, will be as much shorter a time in going, as they
are larger and more convenient than the inside of mail-coaches,
and in which the most brilliant light may be enjoyed, we proclaim
it to be &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; to consent to go by such
vehicles, because they would move inside a tunnel: not
considering that this very circumstance, of being <i>inside</i>
said tunnel, would as certainly secure us from being overturned,
driven against any thing, run away with, breaking down, or any
other of the dangers to which turnpike-road travelling is liable,
as it would give us the ease, comfort, and accommodations of the
cabin of a steam-vessel, instead of the privations and endurances
experienced in mail-coaches.</p>
<p>And as the valves which have been adverted to as fixed at
every quarter, or half, or whole mile, would, in point of effect,
be doors, by means of which exit from the tunnel could be
effected, the bugbear of being &ldquo;shut up in a tunnel many
miles long, with no place to get out of it, if any thing should
happen,&rdquo; need not be seriously replied to.</p>
<p>Such are some of the benefits which laying down a tunnel,
instead of a railway would procure you.&nbsp; But the most
important of all is yet to be mentioned.</p>
<p>As it does not follow that, because you may think proper to
lay a railway down, the public <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>will think proper to use it, it
becomes vital to your interest, that some inducement which shall
lead them to use it, and cause them to prefer the more circuitous
route to the Birmingham Railway by your line, to the more direct
one by the Edgeware Road, should be laid before them.&nbsp; This
inducement will be furnished by the tunnel which I propose to
your adoption.</p>
<p>The carriages which would go in said tunnel, may be rendered
so superior in point of size, of the room they will give to each
passenger, of comfort, and of general accommodation, as to be
more like the cabin of a steam-vessel, rather than any thing else
I can compare them to.</p>
<p>In one of those I used in the tunnel I constructed at
Brighton, above twenty people have sat with a table between them,
covered with provisions, plates, dishes, &amp;c. &amp;c. which
provisions were consumed according to the usual course of a
dinner table: so that accommodations (even to that of a sofa for
each person) which could not be thought of in coach or omnibus
travelling, <i>might</i> be given to passengers.</p>
<p>Owing also to the size and construction of these carriages
admitting of my using the air for springs, their motion would be
soft and (as relates to the avoidance of all jolting)
air-balloon-like, to a degree which you cannot conceive; and
which no railway carriage, far less any common road vehicle,
could compare with.</p>
<p>In point of safety, too, would they be incomparably superior;
since, instead of being liable to break down, to be driven
against any thing, to be run away with, or to be overturned,
&amp;c. &amp;c. these accidents would be so impossible, that
absolute immunity from danger, and certain security to life and
limb, would be consequent on this method of conveyance; while the
rate of transit under which this safety would be secured, being
so great as to admit of the journey being effected in as few
minutes as you thought proper, your route might be rendered as
much shorter as you pleased in point of time, than the route by
the Edgeware road could be rendered.&nbsp; The expense of the
power too, by which your passengers would be conveyed, being
above twenty times cheaper than coaches or omnibuses could convey
them along the Edgeware Road, you would have a still greater
advantage in this particular.&nbsp; It remains, therefore, only
to point out how the public may be caused to take your circuitous
line, in preference to the nearer route by the Edgeware Road.</p>
<p>In order to effect this, and to save the public from having to
go from Hyde Park Corner to your line, as must be done were you
to lay a railway down, I propose bringing your line to Hyde Park
Corner, by extending the tunnel; branching it eastward from your
basin, either through Kensington and Knightsbridge, under the
turnpike road; or (in order to avoid all interference with, or
opposition from, the Turnpike Commissioners) along the shorter
line across the vacant grounds to the south of the road, at the
back of Kensington and Knightsbridge; across (though beneath, and
indeed underground all the way) Earl&rsquo;s Court Lane,
Gloucester Road, Grove Lane, the Brompton Road, and Sloane
Street, to the vacant ground on the North and East of Wilton
Crescent.</p>
<p>I am not, at present, prepared to point out either the best
route, or the best spot for the termination towards Hyde Park
Corner; having investigated only so for as to satisfy myself that
such a course is practicable.</p>
<p>You will, at first, be startled at, and disposed to object to
this extension, because you will suppose that it involves the
outlay which would be required for two additional miles of
tunnel, without bringing in any more return than would be
received from passengers to the Birmingham Railway.&nbsp; This
conception, however, is an erroneous one.</p>
<p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>Were a
method of conveyance in operation, by which the inhabitants of
the west end of Kensington, of Earl&rsquo;s Court, of North End,
of Walham Green, of Brook Green, of Hammersmith, of Turnham
Green, of Chiswick, &amp;c. &amp;c. could be carried (more safely
than by coaches) from your basin to Hyde Park Corner in two or
three minutes, instead of the twenty minutes or nearly half an
hour which it now takes to get over that ground, they would so
prefer your method of conveyance, as to render the additional
outlay required for said two extra miles of tunnel, the most
remunerating portion of your whole line; while, in addition to
enabling you thus to convey passengers, said branch would enable
you also to deliver coals, and other goods at Hyde Park Corner
from your canal, for an expense of less than a penny per ton
carriage from your canal thither; so that you would rival the
Grosvenor Canal, and add importantly to the tonnage trade of your
own canal by it.</p>
<p>Should the Birmingham and Bristol Railways be completed, this
branch would also enable you to convey goods, as well as
passengers, to and from them, and to and from the western parts
of town, more cheaply than could any how else be done; an
accommodation which laying down your railway could not
give.&nbsp; And as I <i>could</i> so construct these two extra
miles of tunnel, as to render their cost&mdash;the cost of the
tunnel itself, i.e.&mdash;not more than about five thousand
pounds per mile, the expense of this branch would not prove any
ruinous addition to your contemplated outlay.</p>
<p>Therefore, for these reasons, I recommend you to prevent its
being necessary that people should pay omnibus (or other)
proprietors, to carry them from Hyde Park Corner to your basin at
Kensington, in order that you may <i>then</i> convey them to the
Birmingham (or Bristol) Railway, by extending your line towards
Hyde Park Corner, in the manner I have pointed out.</p>
<p>Your case, brought into a focus, is as follows.&nbsp; You have
expended a large sum in opening a line of conveyance which, owing
to its not being carried far enough at first, does not combine
all the advantages your situation admits of.&nbsp; You are,
naturally, desirous that it should do this.&nbsp; If you open a
communication for goods with the Grand Junction Canal, by
extending your own canal, you will do this in degree.&nbsp; You
have, therefore, for some years, contemplated carrying your canal
up the height between your basin and the Grand Junction
Canal.&nbsp; But the enormous expense of this has prevented you
from doing it.</p>
<p>Being now informed that your object may be better effected by
a railway, you entertain that idea; and as, were you to lay a
railway down, passengers, as well as goods, might be conveyed by
it, you are desirous of, if possible, bringing the
&ldquo;passenger trade,&rdquo; between the Birmingham Railway and
the west end of London, to your line.</p>
<p>Owing, however, to the distance of your line from the west end
of Town; and to the Edgeware Road, offering a shorter and cheaper
communication from the Birmingham Railway to that part of the
metropolis, your laying down a railway, will, for the reasons I
have pointed out, certainly prove a losing speculation.</p>
<p>As the method I propose would be most importantly cheaper than
a railway, in point of first cost, and still more importantly
cheaper in point of current expenses, I venture to offer it to
your notice.&nbsp; And as it would obviate the objection which
your distance from Hyde Park Corner would occasion, supposing you
were to have a railway, I presume to recommend it to your
consideration, as more worthy notice than any thing else you can
have laid before you; for the reasons, that it will, in the first
place, be much cheaper in point of first cost than any other
method of conveyance <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>you can lay down: second, because it
will be still more economical in point of current expenses:
third, because, in addition to being incomparably safer, as
relates to life and limb, than any other method of conveyance, it
will be so much more expeditious as to render your circuitous
route quicker, <i>in point of time</i>, than the shorter route by
the Edgeware Road, as well as cheaper, in point of charge: and,
fourth, because it will be productive of an important profit,
additional to, and exclusive of, what a railway will bring in;
and which will return no inconsiderable proportion of what it
costs to lay it down.</p>
<p>Were the statements I have given relative to the cost and
expenses of a railway, from my own estimates only, they might be
doubted by you.&nbsp; In order, however, to avoid this, I have
been careful to quote only the &ldquo;evidence,&rdquo; which was
laid before Parliament, and other documents; which leave no doubt
that the first cost and current expenses will be, at least,
<i>equal</i> to what I have stated, though they by no means prove
that they will not be <i>more</i>.</p>
<p>Indeed, it appears susceptible of proof that they will be
more.&nbsp; Mr. Grahame, in his &ldquo;Letter to the Traders and
Carriers on the Navigations, connecting Liverpool and
Manchester,&rdquo; relative to that railway, says, &ldquo;I
pledge myself, however, to prove (in case the fact be denied by
the Directors) that the aggregate expenditure of the half year,
ending on the 31st December, 1832, bears a higher proportion to
the income of that period than the expenses of <i>any</i>
preceding half-year bear to the income of the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Graham also says, &ldquo;The Railway Corporation keep two
separate accounts of expenditure, &ldquo;<i>ordinary</i>&rdquo;
and &ldquo;<i>extraordinary</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;ordinary
expenditure&rdquo; is paid from the annual returns received from
working the railway; and the &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; is paid
by borrowing money, or a creation and sale of shares; which is
termed &ldquo;adding to the capital account.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
ordinary expenditure, only, affects the dividend; and it is the
interest of every one concerned to make <i>that</i> expenditure
appear as low as possible; and, whenever the outlays are
commingled, or doubtful, to throw the burden on the obnoxious
shoulder.&nbsp; This &ldquo;extraordinary outlay,&rdquo; or, as
it is termed, &ldquo;outlay on the railway and works,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Capital Account,&rdquo; has been as great since the
railway was opened, as during the period when it was
forming.&nbsp; The amount thus laid out in the first fifteen
months after the opening of the railway, amounted to nearly
200,000<i>l.</i>&nbsp; The outlay on this account in 1832 is not
stated; but the interest on borrowed money paid in that year, is
given as 10,522<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, while the
interest paid in 1831 was only 5647<i>l.</i> 7<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Railway advocates may dispute this; but <i>that</i> I shall
not heed.&nbsp; Should they, however, <i>disprove</i> it, I shall
not be able to deny that I am liable to the censure due to him
who investigates in the spirit of a partisan, rather than in that
of a candid examinant.</p>
<p>It may be objected, in answer to the advantages which I have
stated would result from your substituting this Pneumatic Railway
for the common railway you contemplate, that you have never heard
of it before, except in the way of ridicule and contempt; while
not only have the engineers of the day condemned it, but also do
even some of yourselves entertain doubts as to the sanity of the
man who can propose such a thing to you.</p>
<p>In allusion to objectors of this latter description, the M. D.
who did me the honour to propose the first Resolution at the
&ldquo;Town Meeting&rdquo; at Brighton, said, in the course of
his speech on the occasion, that &ldquo;Mr. Vallance had had to
contend with the greatest difficulties; such as were enough to
appal any man: he had been derided and ridiculed: his system had
been treated as <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>visionary, theoretical, and fantastic: he had been
called a wild projector&mdash;nay, some had even gone so far as
to say that he was mad.&nbsp; If so, he (Dr. Yates) must say,
with Polonius, &lsquo;there was method in his
madness.&rsquo;&nbsp; And to such insinuations he (Dr. Y.) would
reply, in the words of Hamlet, there was that which &lsquo;sense
and sanity scarce could be delivered of.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With my defence against insinuations of this kind thus
provided, I may turn to the more serious objections of the
engineers whom you may consult: who, I am well aware, will treat
the proposition only as Brindsley&rsquo;s proposal to carry the
canal over the Irwell was treated by the engineers of his
day.</p>
<p>Were this any thing new, I might feel it.&nbsp; But when we
have it on record that the professed engineers of the period have
done the same by <i>every</i> proposition that has been brought
forward, until its being established by others, caused them to
see that money might be made by imitating, instead of continuing
to decry the inventor, their exclamations of
&ldquo;impossible,&rdquo; &ldquo;absurd,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;madness to think of,&rdquo; may well be disregarded.</p>
<p>Had Telford, or Stevenson, or Rennie, or Brunel, or any other
first-rate man, originated the proposition, then, indeed, they
might have had some faith in it!&nbsp; But for an unknown nobody
to do such a thing, is of itself enough to prove that it
<i>cannot</i> be worth attention.</p>
<p>To these gentlemen I reply, by asking them&mdash;to whom are
we indebted for the steam-engine in its application to
steam-vessels, and locomotive purposes, as well as a first mover
for machinery?&nbsp; Savary, its first inventor, was a
miner.&nbsp; Newcomen and Beighton, its first improvers, were,
one of them a country blacksmith, and the other a plumber, while
its grand improver, the great Watt, was a mathematical-instrument
maker.&nbsp; To whom are we indebted for our canals&mdash;for our
nationally-important cotton machinery&mdash;for the public
application of the gas-light principle&mdash;for the system of
railway transmission&mdash;for the hydrostatic press&mdash;and
the other manifold improvements, which have raised us to the
station we fill?&nbsp; Is it to men, who, at the periods when
these improvements were first devised, were of high name, and
established reputation as civil engineers?&nbsp; Hear what one
whose situation enabled him to decide, says on the
subject:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What has been the means of raising our
native country to that eminence in civilization which renders her
the admiration of the world?&nbsp; Her improvements in the arts
and sciences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From whom have those improvements chiefly sprung?&nbsp;
From men who have emerged from the humbler walks of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was Sir Richard Arkwright; a man to whose genius
this country is indebted for very much of its commercial
prosperity; to whose improvements in the machinery for spinning
cotton, we are indebted for being enabled to keep the cotton
trade chiefly confined to ourselves.&nbsp; What, I say, was the
great Arkwright?&nbsp; A barber.&nbsp; Yet do we owe our proud
superiority in this department of our national greatness to the
unassisted efforts of Dick the barber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was Ferguson?&nbsp; A simple peasant; a man, who,
wrapped in his plaid, passed the winter nights on the ground in
contemplating the heavens; and who, by arranging his string of
beads on the cold heath, at length completed a map of the stars,
and raised himself to the knowledge of our late sovereign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was Dr. Herschel, the discoverer of so many
important astronomical facts?&nbsp; A boy who played the pipe and
tabor in a foreign regimental band.&nbsp; Who was the great
Watt?&nbsp; A mathematical instrument maker.</p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>&ldquo;Who was Smeaton, the builder of the Eddystone
lighthouse, and the first engineer of his day?&nbsp; An
attorney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was the great Brindsley, whose canals have given
such an accession of power to our commerce, by the facilities of
internal communication?&nbsp; A country millwright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicholson was a cabin boy: and Ramadge, the best maker
of reflecting telescopes in the world, was a cutler.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In continuation of this list of &ldquo;nobodies,&rdquo; to
whom we owe so much of our national greatness, I ask, to whom are
we indebted for the very inventions which the engineers of the
present day claim as their own, with justice equal to that
wherewith the organ-<i>blower</i> considered the tones of the
instrument <i>his</i>?</p>
<p>Railways have been in use among us for a century and a half;
and, notwithstanding that those of this remote date, were no more
comparable with those of the present day, than the matchlocks of
the same period are with a modern gun, the <i>principle</i> was
equally developed in the one case as in the other.&nbsp; Yet is
there no engineer who can claim the credit of having said
&ldquo;As this principle admits of most important benefits being
conferred on society, provided it be worked out, and carried to
the perfection it admits of, I will devote myself to such working
out and perfecting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Locomotive engines have been seen among us for these thirty
years.&nbsp; Yet did the engineers of the day no more perceive
and seize <i>their</i> advantages than they did those of
railways.&nbsp; But, after the perception and talent of various
persons, who were in business had, for the purpose of adapting
them to the necessities of their different trades, so improved
railways and locomotive engines, as to have rendered the latter
capable of running <i>regularly</i> upon the former, at rates of
from five to eleven miles an hour, forth came our engineers, and,
claiming both inventions as their own, set themselves up as
having enlarged the boundaries of science, enabled man to
outstrip the fleetest animals, and almost to vie with the
winds!</p>
<p>And, last of all, I ask, to whom are we indebted for the
latest important discovery, by which unprofessional perception
has shewn, that what <i>every</i> engineer of the present day had
pronounced to be, not only a mathematically-demonstrated, but
also a <i>practically</i>-proved &ldquo;impossibility,&rdquo; is
as perfectly, and as easily practicable, as it was for Columbus
to make the egg stand on its end.</p>
<p>We have nearly 3000 miles of canals in the island; the draught
on which being twenty times easier than on common roads, and the
&ldquo;wear and tear&rdquo; equally less, it has, ever since they
were first cut, been an important object to render the rate of
conveyance along them rapid enough to induce persons to travel
from place to place <i>on</i> them, as well as to send their
goods by them.</p>
<p>This became more particularly important, when, in consequence
of the rapidity attained on railways, it was found that they
could combine the conveyance of passengers with that of goods;
and I do not hesitate to say, that any engineer, who had, in
1825, informed the Canal interest that he had discovered a method
by which conveyance could be effected on canals at the same rate
as by mail-coaches, or post-chaises on turn pike-roads, and for
one-tenth of their expense of draught, might have made terms with
them for the adoption of this method, which should have brought
him in above 100,000<i>l.</i> sterling.</p>
<p>But, so far from the engineers of the day informing the canal
interest that they could do any thing for them in this case, they
universally preached despair with respect to it; satisfying them,
by mathematical demonstration, that, owing to the resistance of
fluids to bodies moving through <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>them, increasing according to the
square of the velocity, rapidity of transmission along canals was
no more possible than for a coal-barge to beat to windward like a
cutter.</p>
<p>It is true they admitted that the steam-engine gave them power
enough to more vessels on canals as rapidly as steamers move on
rivers.&nbsp; But, they said, owing to the surge which it was
<i>unavoidable</i> such rapid motion <i>must</i> create, the
banks of the canals would be so soon washed down, that it was
impossible to avoid ruining the canals, if rapid conveyance were
attempted on them.&nbsp; Therefore, though steam has been in use
as a moving power on our rivers for above these twenty years, it
has never yet been employed for a similar purpose on our canals,
except in the way of experiment.</p>
<p>In consequence of these things, they could do nothing to meet
the wishes of the canal interest: and, in the evidence on the
Birmingham Railway, before the Lords&rsquo; Committees, on the
29th June, 1832, it is stated, in answer to an inquiry as to what
was the quickest kind of canal communication between London and
Birmingham, that &ldquo;The fly boats go by the shortest route,
and they are three days and three nights on the
road.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now as this &ldquo;shortest route&rdquo; is
152&frac12; miles, it appears that the quickest rate of canal
conveyance by &ldquo;fly boats&rdquo; was less than 2&#8539;th
miles an hour; while in answer to the question, &ldquo;What time
is occupied by the slow boats?&rdquo; it is replied, &ldquo;About
six or seven days: they seldom travel at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this state of despair on the part of the canal interest,
and amid this chorus of &ldquo;impossible,&rdquo; on the part of
the whole of the engineers of the present day, a private
gentleman (William Houston, Esq. of Johnstone Castle) became
impressed with the opinion that, equally as we can, by giving it
rapid motion, cause a flat stone to skim over the surface of the
water (as boys do, when playing at what they call &ldquo;making
ducks and drakes&rdquo;) so might we, by giving rapid motion to a
properly constructed boat an a canal, cause it, not only to skim
<i>over</i> the water, so as to avoid raising the wave which the
engineers had pronounced equally unavoidable as it would be fatal
to the banks of canals, but also much more easily than boats can
be drawn <i>through</i> the water.</p>
<p>On putting this thought into practice, Mr. Houston found the
result to be what he had anticipated; and the consequence is,
that it is now established by actual and <i>daily</i> practice on
the Paisley and Ardrossan Canal, that boats which carry more
passengers than (on an average) the locomotive engines, of twenty
and thirty horse power each, draw on the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway, at rates of from 15 to 20 miles an hour, <a
name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62"
class="citation">[62]</a> are drawn from Johnstone to Glasgow at
the rate of ten miles an how by <i>two</i> horses only; while a
velocity so high as 15 miles an hour has been attained:
&ldquo;and this speed was not limited by <i>the labour of the
draught</i>, but by <i>the power of speed</i> of the
horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words, that which the whole of the engineers of the
present day had pronounced and <i>demonstrated</i> to be utterly
impossible, is now constantly done, several times every day, as a
regular passenger-carrying business, on the Paisley and Ardrossan
Canal.</p>
<p>And, although the charges for this rate of conveyance are
&ldquo;just one-half, and one-third, of the fares in the
Liverpool Railway coaches, the profits are such, as to have
induced the proprietors to quadruple the number of boats on the
canal;&rdquo; while the passengers, instead of being boxed up as
<a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>in the
railway coaches, and exposed to the weather, as in the railway
&ldquo;second class carriages,&rdquo; may either take exercise on
the decks, or seat themselves in the long cabins of these
passenger-boats.</p>
<p>As this method of rapid canal conveyance is becoming generally
adopted, this simple idea of a private gentleman, has not only
put to shame the whole of the engineering talent of the present
day, but has also possessed the kingdom of nearly 3000 miles of
liquid way, which, as if by the stroke of a wand, are raised from
the low value of heavy, miry, cross country roads, on which no
greater velocity than that of a carrier&rsquo;s waggon could be
attained, to the high value, not merely of the best
turnpike-roads, on which the conveyance of persons, at mail-coach
and post-chaise rates, can be effected, but also of routes on
which two horses can (and daily do) draw one hundred people as
fast and (I understand) <i>more</i> easily than four draw sixteen
persons on our best mail-coach roads, with less than
one-twentieth the wear and tear to the vehicles than takes place
as to coaches on roads: on advantage, the money value of which
will be inadequately expressed by saying, that as it would cost
above thirty thousand pounds per mile to give us roads on which
the same power could do the same work, with the same small
expense of wear, tear, and current expenses, the simple thought
of a private gentleman, whom the engineers of the day would have
pronounced a &ldquo;nobody&rdquo; in point of scientific
authority, has possessed the nation of what it would have cost
above one hundred millions sterling to purchase, had said
engineers been employed to procure an equal amount of roads, of
equally easy draught, and little &ldquo;wear and tear&rdquo; for
us.</p>
<p>Yet are these gentlemen looked up to as infallible; and
allowed to fulminate their anathemas with respect to what they
please to pronounce &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; as if they were
omniscient.</p>
<p>The actual charges the passenger-boats, which now run daily
(at the rate of ten miles an hour) between Johnstone and Glasgow,
are, one penny per head per mile in the first cabin, and three
farthings per head per mile in the second cabin.</p>
<p>How much less these charges are than turnpike-road fares, need
not be pointed out: my object being to submit, that equally as
our canals having for these three-quarters of a century remained
only routes for goods at carriers&rsquo;-waggon rates, when they
might, all along, have been routes for passengers at the highest
rates whereat it is possible for horses to go, proves that the
engineers of the day knew nothing whatever of a subject which
they professed <i>fully and entirely</i> to understand&mdash;so
may they be equally ignorant of the merits of the proposition
which they have so ridiculed and condemned me for presuming to
bring forward; and which is, as exactly what <i>they</i> term it,
as they <i>demonstrated</i> it to be &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; to
be conveyed at mail-coach and posting-rates along canals.</p>
<p>Now, great as is the honour due to the engineers of the
present day, for thus permitting the accidental thought of a
private gentleman to possess the nation (as it were by the stroke
of a wand) of 3000 miles of liquid way, over which conveyance may
take place at rates of from 10 to 15 miles an hour, for one-tenth
the expense, and less than one-tenth of the wear and tear that
takes place on roads, after they had <i>demonstrated</i> that no
greater rate than two or three miles an hour could be attained on
said routes; and, greatly as the canal interest must be indebted
to them, for suffering them (the canal interest), in consequence
of said <i>demonstration</i>, to lose the millions upon millions
they might have received of the public, for conveyance at these
rates of 10 or 15 miles <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>an hour, during the three-quarters of
a century canals have been in operation among us&mdash;equally as
the engineers <i>thus</i> deserve public gratitude, do they also
deserve it for the manner in which they have suffered the law of
motion, by means of which the stage-coachman &ldquo;swings&rdquo;
his vehicle up the first part of a hill, to remain useless with
respect to that improvement of our turnpike-roads which it admits
of; and which, though not equal in money-value to the
&ldquo;idea&rdquo; of Mr. Houston, which has just been described,
is yet highly important.</p>
<p>The law itself is &ldquo;old as the hills;&rdquo; and,
notwithstanding that the advantage taken of it by stage-coachmen
when coming to the bottom of a rise, is not <i>quite</i> of such
long standing, yet is it old enough to have pointed out an
advantageous alteration in the arrangement of all our turnpike
roads, had the engineers under whose direction said roads were
laid out, but availed themselves of it.</p>
<p>By the table given on page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page33">33</a></span> it appears, that if a vehicle be
moving on a level with a velocity of 2&frac34; miles an hour, its
momentum will (under the circumstances there stated) carry it up
a rise to three inches of perpendicular height: while, if the
rate of motion be twice, and four times 2&frac34; miles an
hour&mdash;i.e. 5&frac12; and 11 miles&mdash;the momentum will
carry it up heights of one foot and four feet respectively: and
the following table gives the altitudes due to every intermediate
mile of rate:</p>

</table>
<p>A velocity of six miles an hour being thus capable of giving
momentum sufficient to enable any vehicle to surmount an ascent
of above one foot in perpendicular height, let the angle of
ascent <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>or
rate of rise, be what it might, it has been necessary only to lay
out our turnpike-roads in alternate short levels, with sharp
rises of one foot in height between them, similar to the line
below, to render all our roads level, in point of effect, to
every vehicle which went at the rate of six miles an hour; since,
as the <i>continued</i> draught of the horse would overcome,
neutralise, and (as relates to its counteractive effect)
annihilate the friction of the wheels and axes during the ascent,
the momentum imparted by that velocity would enable the vehicle
<i>of itself</i> to rise up, and surmount the ascent, without any
<i>extra</i> effort on the part of the horse: while, supposing
that the practice of stage-coachmen were to be imitated, and the
horses of these six-miles-an-hour vehicles pushed to a pace of
twelve miles an hour for a few yards before the wheels actually
touched these rises, so as to give the vehicle a velocity of 12
miles an hour at the moment of its <i>beginning</i> to ascend
them, the momentum imparted by this velocity would carry the
vehicle up four feet nine inches perpendicular, instead of one;
so that the road might be laid out in alternate levels and rises
of four feet.</p>
<p>It is true that, supposing this principle to be acted on, half
the width of the road must be left in the usual manner, in order
to enable waggons, which do not move faster than two or three
miles an hour, to pass over it.&nbsp; But as the slow rate of two
miles an hour will give momentum enough to admit of a rise of
1&#8541; inches being surmounted, the principle might be taken
some advantage of, even on the half of the road appropriated to
waggons; since rises not exceeding 1&frac12; inches each, could
be surmounted by vehicles which did not move faster than two
miles an hour.</p>
<p>However, leaving the waggon-half of the road to the usual
arrangement, the advantage of, as it were, doing away with all
hills and rises, and rendering all our roads level (in point of
effect) to all vehicles travelling at the rate of six miles an
hour, might have amply repaid the expense of this suggested
alteration in the <i>form</i> of the roads, had the engineers
under whose direction they were cut, but laid them out in that
manner: while, supposing that a rate of 16 miles an hour could be
attained by pushing the horse to a gallop <i>just before</i>
reaching the ascent, the levels and rises might be laid out in
gradations of eight feet each instead of four feet.</p>
<p>But let the heights of these proposed elevations be what they
might, the advantage of (in effect) doing away with all hills and
rises, and of rendering our roads level to us all over the
kingdom would be attained; which might prove ample reward for
varying the mere form of the roads; and would not, I think, have
been unworthy the notice even of our omniscient engineers;
notwithstanding that the way in, and degree to which they have
neglected and slighted this law of motion, with respect to its
application to railways as well as to turnpike-roads, proves
them, one and all, to have been equally percipient of its
advantages, as they were of the practicability of rapid
conveyance on canals; and as they <i>are</i> of the merits of the
method of transmission which the individual who has now the
honour of addressing you is presumptuous enough to think
deserving even of THEIR attention: omniscient as they deem
themselves relative to it; and omnipotent as they have, hitherto,
proved, with respect to its condemnation and rejection.</p>
<p>Should I, however, be fortunate enough to meet with any who
will measure the competence of these gentlemen thus to condemn,
by the following standards, I cannot but trust that my appeal
from their decision will be favourably received.</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>The
question, divested of technicalities, resolves itself into the
three following considerations.</p>
<p>First, can we construct iron (or any other kind of) tunnels,
such as would be requisite for the operation of the
principle?&nbsp; Secondly, can we construct air-pumps large
enough to exhaust from the said tunnels with the necessary
rapidity?&nbsp; And, thirdly, can we make steam-engines powerful
enough to work these air-pumps?</p>
<p>Now as there is no one who denies that we have the power of
making tunnels of any size, not exceeding (say) twelve feet in
diameter, nor that we can form the separate segments, or pieces,
in which such tunnels might be cast, into cylindrical
&ldquo;lengths,&rdquo; of from ten to fifteen feet each, so as to
lay them down and connect them as (suppose for the present) gas
mains are laid down and united&mdash;as no one denies this, the
second question, relating to the air-pumps, is the first to be
replied to.</p>
<p>In 1827 there were, in Great Britain, 284 smelting furnaces;
the quantity of iron made during that year by which, was 690,000
tons.</p>
<p>Blast apparatus being as indispensable appendages to smelting
furnaces, as the flux is to the ironstone which is to be smelted
in those furnaces, it follows, that (with the possibility of
exception where one blast apparatus may be made to serve more
than one furnace) there must, seven years ago, have been 284 sets
of pneumatic apparatus for urging the fires of these furnaces to
the necessary intensity, by forcing currents of air into
them.&nbsp; These apparatus formerly varied in form, from common
bellows on a large scale, to the diversities of the &ldquo;water
blast.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the whole of these varieties of blast
apparatus are now found so inferior to what are termed
&ldquo;blowing cylinders&rdquo; that no one who erects a smelting
furnace ever thinks of applying to it any other means for urging
its fire than this latter description of apparatus.</p>
<p>These &ldquo;blowing cylinders&rdquo; are all air-pumps on a
large scale; differing from the common air-pump only in being of
iron instead of brass; in having their valves so arranged as to
cause them, instead of exhausting air <i>from</i> the vessel they
operate on, to blow <i>into</i> it; and in their being as much
larger than a common air-pump as the &ldquo;monster mortar&rdquo;
used at the late reduction of the citadel of Antwerp is than a
boy&rsquo;s sixpenny cannon.</p>
<p>The largest of this kind of air-pumps that I have seen was
nine feet in diameter, by an equal or rather superior height;
though an iron-founder has informed me that he once cast one of
eleven feet in diameter.&nbsp; And it is unquestionable, that it
will require only the preparation of the necessary moulding and
boring, &amp;c. &amp;c. apparatus, to make any number, of any
diameter we please, not exceeding (say) twelve feet.&nbsp;
Supposing them to be 11.3 feet in diameter, their area would be
equal to 100 square feet; and, supposing the velocity with which
their pistons moved, to be only half that of the average velocity
of the pistons of steam-engines, each of these air-pumps would
cause 11,000 cubic feet (i.e. about 70,000 gallons) of air, to
pass through each of them per minute; which air would be drawn
out of, or forced into, any thing, according as the valves were
arranged.</p>
<p>Every one of such pumps that was used to exhaust air from a
tunnel of eight feet in diameter would produce a current in it,
moving at the rate of two miles and a half an hour; while,
supposing that its piston moved at the same velocity whereat the
pistons of steam-engines in general move, this current would pass
through the tunnel at the rate of five miles an hour.</p>
<p>It being evident, then, that it is necessary only properly to
arrange the size and number of the pumps, to cause the atmosphere
to rush along the tunnel at any rate we desire; and it being a
fact that we have, in daily operation, about 300 such air-pumps
as these (though not quite so large) <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>there is only one remaining shelter
behind which these &ldquo;impossibleists&rdquo; can pretend to
screen themselves.</p>
<p>The first steam-engine which Boulton and Watt erected in their
manufactory of Soho as a specimen for the examination of those
who wanted such machines, was about the year 1780.&nbsp; The
exact number we now have among us there are no means of
ascertaining.&nbsp; But the authority which I have quoted for the
existence of 15,000 steam-engines in Great Britain, states them
to be of the average power of twenty-five horses.</p>
<p>If this may be received, the whole amount of &ldquo;horse
power&rdquo; in operation among us in 1831 was equal to that of
375,000 horses.&nbsp; And even though it should be necessary to
lower this down to M. Dupin&rsquo;s estimate of 200,000 horses in
1824, there would remain an aggregate ample for our
purpose.&nbsp; Since, if there was not in 1790 <i>one</i>
steam-engine in Manchester, while there are now nearly 300 there,
it may safely be assumed that so much the larger proportion of
the thousands of them which are now spread over the kingdom have
been made within the last thirty years, as to admit of its being
fairly inferred that we have, for many years past, constructed
them at a rate equal to ten thousand horses&rsquo; power per
annum.</p>
<p>Yet, with these facts almost as easily verified as it would be
to obtain copies of all the newspapers published in the kingdom,
and with some of these engines so large as to be equal to 300, or
500, or (as quoted in page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page46">46</a></span>) even 1000 horses&rsquo; power, do
these &ldquo;impossibleists&rdquo; say we cannot obtain power
enough to work the air-pumps we should require to pump the air
out of the tunnel.&nbsp; Just as, twenty years ago, they said we
could not use steam to carry us across the seas, nor gas to light
our streets.</p>
<p>In reply to a demand of the great Lord Chatham that a certain
naval force should be ready by a certain day for an expedition be
contemplated; and which, the nature of the service rendered it
necessary should be despatched as promptly as it was determined
on, the then first lord of the admiralty stated, as an intended
conclusion to several notes (or messages) which had passed
between the two departments on the subject, that &ldquo;it could
not be done, because it was <i>impossible</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Inform the first lord from me,&rdquo; said the minister,
&ldquo;that the service of the state requires the
<i>immediate</i> despatch of the expedition: and that if he, with
the military marine of the kingdom at his order by virtue of his
office, and the commercial marine at his command by the course of
hiring transports, delays the departure of the expedition because
<i>he</i> deems it impossible, I will impeach him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Under this alternative, the &ldquo;impossibility&rdquo; vanished,
and the expedition sailed.</p>
<p>Now as the facts which I have adduced relative to the
existence of all the necessary means for rendering importantly
available to general use the principle here described, prove that
the gentlemen of that profession which is devoted to the
practical application of mechanical science to the public service
have, for these seven years, proclaimed to be
&ldquo;impossible&rdquo; that which is as easily practicable as
it was for the first lord of the admiralty to prepare the naval
part of the expedition referred to, I leave it to themselves to
make evident why they should not be impeached, as equally
traitors to the cause of practical science, as the first lord of
the admiralty would have been to the state, had the expedition
not sailed at the period the minister required.</p>
<p>Those who will give themselves the trouble of the calculations
necessary to establish the truth of the preceding statements
relative to the effect of momentum, it will be unnecessary to
remind of <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>any of the occurrences which prove it.&nbsp; But those
who do not choose to take that trouble, may be reminded, that a
circumstance often witnessed, gives practical demonstration of
the accuracy of these statements.</p>
<p>During certain adhesive states of the crust of the road, it is
frequently seen when travelling, that the pressure of the wheels
causes particles of earth to adhere to, and rise from the ground,
sticking to the tire of the wheel.</p>
<p>The adhesion of these particles of earth being, however, soon
destroyed by the centrifugal force imparted by the revolution of
the wheel, they become, the moment <i>it</i> loosens them from
the wheel, and allows the other influence to operate, projected
in directions varying according to the position of the part of
the wheel to which they adhered, at the moment of their quitting
it.</p>
<p>Some of them, being carried to the top of the wheel, fly
forward; but the majority, leaving the wheel at about the height
of the axle-tree, become projected vertically, and are seen
bobbing up and down by the windows of the carriage, somewhat like
motes in the sunbeam.</p>
<p>Their thus rising and falling may, perhaps, hitherto have been
observed, without being regarded as demonstrative of any
principle which may be rendered subservient to our
purposes.&nbsp; But as they are, in point of fact, evidences,
that the momentum imparted by the velocity at which the tire of
the wheels is revolving, will cause bodies to rise to the height
of three or four feet perpendicular, above the point of the wheel
from which they fly; and as this velocity is exactly commensurate
with that at which the carriage goes over the ground, they are
unquestionable proofs, that, provided friction be annihilated as
relates to counteractive effect, by the continued operation of
the moving power, the vehicle itself would ascend an inclined
plane of <i>any</i> rate of ascent, to the same height to which
they rise above the position of the part of the wheel they
adhered to, at the moment of their flying from it.</p>
<p>But, to leave this question relative to momentum, and return
to that of the steam-engines and air-pumps.</p>
<p>It being the property of air to neutralise, or absorb, a
smaller portion of whatever impulse may be imparted to it, than,
perhaps, any other ponderable medium nature offers us, the power
of the steam-engines which operated on the air-pumps that
exhausted air from the tunnel, might be brought to
bear,&mdash;and that too, without their energy being so
diminished as even to <i>approach</i> an insuperable
objection&mdash;on the vehicles in it; and an effect in
consequence produced, which we cannot, at first, conceive to be
possible.</p>
<p>It is evident, that it will not require the power of the
engines (each equal to several hundred horses&rsquo; power), by
which the air-pumps would be worked, to move one, or even many
vehicles.&nbsp; What then will become of the surplus power?&nbsp;
Will it be lost in overcoming the friction of the air, as
adverted to at page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page41">41</a></span>; or, rather, may it not operate to
increase the rate at which the vehicles will move?&nbsp; And if
so, how many times will the rate at which we may be conveyed,
exceed that at which we now travel, and what is the limit that
will be attained in this particular?</p>
<p>It is well known that air will rush into a vacuum at the rate
of nearly a thousand miles an hour.&nbsp; Now although it is no
more expected we should be conveyed at any such rate as that,
than it is intended we should be placed in a vacuum, yet are,
both this almost inconceivable velocity, and what is generally
expressed by the term &ldquo;vacuum,&rdquo; so connected with the
subject of consideration, that it becomes unavoidable to advert
to them, injurious as they must prove, and strongly as they will
array our preconceived notions and prejudices against the
proposition.</p>
<p><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>It
cannot be denied that we have the power of laying down a tunnel,
such as has been referred to, and of adapting a railway to the
inside of it, for any distance we please: and, though it may not
be in our power so to connect the separate &ldquo;lengths&rdquo;
or cylinders which compose it, as to render the joints perfectly
air-tight against a vacuum, yet, with reference to the trivial
degrees of exhaustion necessary for the purpose here
contemplated, every joint may most easily be made
&ldquo;air-tight&rdquo;: since, supposing the degree of
exhaustion to be equal to the pressure at which gas is forced
through the mains of a public company whose works I know, a load
of above 100 tons would be carried along a tunnel of eight feet
in diameter, at whatever rate the air was pumped out of it.&nbsp;
Equally certain, as it therefore becomes, that we have the power
of extending this tunnel at pleasure, is it, that the power of
making and working any number of air-pumps, such as have been
referred to, will enable us to exhaust from, and consequently
cause air to rush through it, at rates so vastly exceeding any at
which we now travel, that our preconceived notions and prejudices
cause us to look on the proposition as both impossible and
absurd.</p>
<p>One of the circumstances which at first strikes us as fatal to
the proposition, is the inability to respire, which we all feel
we should be liable to, if conveyed rapidly <i>through</i> the
air.&nbsp; A moment&rsquo;s reflection will, however, enable us
to see that this objection has no application whatever to the
case.&nbsp; It is not proposed that we shall be conveyed rapidly
<i>through</i> the air, but that we shall cause air, which we
have first set in rapid motion, <i>to convey us along with
it</i>, <i>as fast as itself goes</i>: a state of things so
different from going through, or against, and meeting the air,
that our supposed objection does not apply to the case.</p>
<p>Stating facts will, however, be the best way of settling this
question; and for this purpose the experience of our aeronauts is
referred to.&nbsp; Much as they have sometimes been
inconvenienced from the rarity of the air, at the heights to
which they have ascended, yet have we never heard them complain
of being unable to breathe freely, owing to the velocity with
which they were carried along over the earth&rsquo;s surface,
notwithstanding that they have been conveyed at rates of 70, 80,
and, in one instance, 160 miles an hour.&nbsp; And why? because
that which was the cause of motion went with them.&mdash;&ldquo;I
had not,&rdquo; says Lunardi, in his account of the first ascent
ever made in England, &ldquo;the slightest sense of motion from
the machine.&nbsp; I knew not whether I went swiftly or
slowly&mdash;whether it ascended or descended&mdash;whether it
was agitated or tranquil, but by the appearance or disappearance
of objects on the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rapidly, therefore, as they
have moved, yet have they felt as if in a calm.&nbsp; Now exactly
similar in point of respiration, would be the feeling of those
who might be conveyed in the proposed tunnel.&nbsp; The air,
being the cause of motion, must go, <i>at least</i>, equally fast
as it drove them, and necessarily be wherever they were.&nbsp;
Let the rate of motion therefore, be what it might, the feeling
of those who experienced it, must prove that of being in a
perfect calm.</p>
<p>Nor are the objections we at first conceive, relative to the
effect which pumping air from the tunnel, and producing what only
the word vacuum (inapplicable as it is) will enable us to convey
the idea of, at all more tenable.&nbsp; The degree to which air
would be exhausted from the tunnel might scarcely ever be
sufficient to sink a barometer two inches lower than one exposed
to the atmosphere stood at; so that even were we exposed to it no
inconvenience would be felt. <a name="citation69"></a><a
href="#footnote69" class="citation">[69]</a>&nbsp; But we <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>never shall
be exposed to it, any more than those who witness the cruel
experiment of putting a mouse under the receiver of an air-pump,
and then exhausting it, are exposed to what the little animal
suffers.&nbsp; Between those who <i>see</i> and the poor creature
which <i>feels</i> the effect of the apparatus, is the side of
the receiver.&nbsp; And between the part of the tunnel in which
the exhaustion, or rather the difference of density is, and the
passengers in the vehicle, would be the <i>end</i> of the
vehicle; so that though <i>close to them</i> would be an
atmosphere rarer than (we will suppose) it might prove pleasant
to be in, yet would the atmosphere <i>they actually were in</i>
be the same as that of the air at large.&nbsp; No inconvenience,
therefore, can be experienced in this particular.</p>
<p>Equally untenable is the idea we take up, that it will be
impossible so to adapt the ends of the vehicles to the inside of
the tunnel, as to cause them to act as pistons in preventing the
passage of the air by them, without occasioning friction to a
degree which should deprive us of all the advantages the air
would otherwise give, as a mean of communicating motion.</p>
<p>In the last carriage which I had for the tunnel I constructed
at Brighton, there was a space of above an inch and a half in
width left all round between the <i>piston</i> part of the
carriage and the tunnel, through which air rushed
unimpeded.&nbsp; Yet did not this &ldquo;windage,&rdquo; or leak,
though equal in the aggregate, to an aperture of three square
feet, prevent the carriage from springing forward to the impulse
of the air-pumps, with a readiness I was surprised at.&nbsp; Nor
did it ever cause the least <i>perceptible</i> diminution in
their effect; owing to the small quantity of air that passed
through it, in comparison with the immense quantity exhausted by
the pumps.</p>
<p>When the Brighton Committee rode in that tunnel, one of them
brought with him a mountain barometer, that he might ascertain
the degree of &ldquo;vacuum&rdquo; or exhaustion necessary to
move the carriage.&nbsp; This barometer was accordingly suspended
in the part where the &ldquo;vacuum&rdquo; was to be produced,
and the vernier adjusted with the greatest accuracy.&nbsp; But to
his surprise the degree of exhaustion was not sufficient to lower
the barometer in the <i>least</i> degree.&nbsp; Being aware of
this, I had spirit gauges previously prepared, one of which was
fixed in the end of the carriage.&nbsp; But even this gauge,
though nearly fifteen times more sensitive than the barometer,
was affected hardly enough to be visible, the amount of
&ldquo;vacuum&rdquo; indicated by it, being only about ten grains
per square inch, or <i>less</i> than the ten-thousandth part of a
vacuum.</p>
<p>Nor would the quantity of air that rushed by the
<i>piston-end</i> of the carriage be at all important, even when
travelling at <i>very</i> great velocities, and with heavy
loads.&nbsp; In a tunnel of the diameter which would be proper
for such lines as those to Bristol, or South Wales, the pressure
requisite to move a load of 100 tons would not be more than about
100 grains per square inch; which would cause air to rush past
the piston-end of the carriage at the rate of about 30 feet per
second.&nbsp; Therefore, even could no better adjustment of the
piston-end of the carriage and the inside of the tunnel be
effected, than took place with respect to that at Brighton, only
90 cubic feet of air per second would rush past, even were the
carriages standing still; which is only one-tenth of what the
air-pumps I used there were capable of exhausting in the same
time; while, on such a line as the Bristol, or South Wales, it
would not be one-hundredth of what the exhausting apparatus would
take out in the same period; so that not one-hundredth of the
power would be lost by it: and even this hundredth could easily
be reduced to a thousandth: the space left between the piston-end
of the carriage in the tunnel at Brighton being <i>purposely</i>
an inch and a half in width, in order that I might shew, by
actual proof, how utterly unimportant was <i>that</i> objection
which engineers of the <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>highest name and reputation had
assured me must, <i>inevitably</i>, prove fatal to the motion of
<i>any</i> carriage in <i>any</i> tunnel.</p>
<p>And as the carriage, instead of standing still, would be
moving forward, the loss of power, which would, otherwise, result
from the pressure requisite to <i>give the velocity</i> as well
as move the load, would be equally unimportant as that arising
from the pressure requisite to move the load alone.</p>
<p>With pressures so trivial as these capable of producing
practical effects, and with it fully practicable so to adjust the
&ldquo;piston&rdquo; part of the carriages to the tunnel, as to
render this &ldquo;windage,&rdquo; or leak, perhaps less than
one-hundredth of that which I <i>purposely</i> caused in the
tunnel at Brighton, there can be no difficulty, either in
preventing any important quantity of air from rushing past the
carriages; or in so connecting the &ldquo;lengths&rdquo; of which
the tunnel would be composed, as to render the joints
air-tight.</p>
<p>And as there are <i>no</i> objections which the engineers can
bring forward, that cannot be replied to in an equally
satisfactory manner, I need not trouble you with any additional
answer to them.</p>
<p>It is now four years ago since the locomotive engine
competition took place on the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway.&nbsp; In all probability no proprietor of the Kensington
Canal happened to be present at that contest; yet is it equally
probable that all were as fully convinced of the fact from the
accounts which appeared in the newspapers, as if you had seen
it.&nbsp; Now though I cannot give the conviction arising from
the evidence of your senses, yet can I give stronger evidence
than the public vehicles of intelligence gave as to that
competition, by referring you to the public authorities and
records of Brighton, to know whether I did not carry an appointed
number of its inhabitants to and fro, as the locomotive engines
went during that competition; &ldquo;when,&rdquo; says Mr.
Treasurer Booth, in his &ldquo;Account of the Liverpool and
Manchester Railway,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the prescribed distance,
it should be understood, was, owing to the circumstances of the
railway, obliged to be accomplished, by moving backwards and
forward on a level plane of one mile and three quarters in
length.&rdquo;&nbsp; I did not, it is true, carry those gentlemen
so far as those engines went.&nbsp; Nor, indeed, was there any
occasion for it.&nbsp; Had it been necessary, they could have
continued riding to and fro in my tunnel, as long as the
locomotives ran to and fro on the railway.&nbsp; But, as when
they had satisfied themselves that there was no trickery in the
motion of the carriage, and that it was <i>really</i> moved by
the air, they had, then, seen all that it was necessary to see,
to convince them that a longer tunnel would enable me to move a
carriage equally far, as a longer railway would have admitted of
the locomotive engines going, they gave over riding,
&ldquo;because,&rdquo; as the Editor of the Brighton Herald says,
in the extract which I have quoted from that paper,
&ldquo;because they became so convinced that the invisible and
intangible medium we breathe, might be rendered a safe and
expeditious means of getting us from one place to another, as to
be tired of riding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Were it necessary for your interest that a gas-pipe should be
laid throughout the line you propose, your inquiry of the
engineer you might employ would be, not whether the gas would
pass through such a length of pipe, because you know that to have
been long established, and to be every day acted upon, but what
would be the <i>expense</i> of it; that is, it would be a money
question, not a question of practicability.</p>
<p>The tunnel I constructed at Brighton was nearly eight feet in
diameter, while the air-pumps I adapted to it were large enough
to make an artificial wind blow through it at the rate of ten
miles an hour.&nbsp; And doubling, tripling, quadrupling, &amp;c.
&amp;c. the size, or number of the pumps, would have doubled,
tripled, &amp;c. &amp;c. the rate at which this wind blew.</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>A
common size for gas mains is eight inches.&nbsp; Were it
propounded to you&mdash;&ldquo;Can a mouse run through a
rat-hole, let that bole be as long as it may?&rdquo; your answer
would not be dubious.&nbsp; Why, then, if it be proved, that we
can, with pneumatic apparatus of an almost infinitely less
efficient nature than that which I purpose using, make air move
through smaller pipes five, fifteen, or even fifty miles long, <a
name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72"
class="citation">[72]</a> should any doubt be entertained whether
air-pumps will cause it to move through one of eight feet in
diameter; more particularly, when it is well known, that the
larger the pipe the less the proportionate friction; and when
your line will be little more than two miles long.</p>
<p>The pressure by which the gas is driven through the pipes of
the work I know the most of, is equal to an ounce and a half per
square inch.&nbsp; A similar pressure on the carriage in my
tunnel would have moved above one hundred tons.&nbsp; The length
of your line would be only about eighty times longer than the
tunnel I constructed; and as the area of your tunnel would be
nearly 150 times larger than the eight-inch mains through which
the gas is carried many times farther than the length of your
line, there need be no more question as to whether, or not, the
principle will act throughout your line, merely because it is
eighty times longer than my tunnel, than there is whether gas
would pass through eighty lengths of gas-pipe.</p>
<p>And as the joints which connect the different
&ldquo;lengths&rdquo; of gas-pipes can easily be made air-tight,
so could the &ldquo;lengths&rdquo; and joints of the
tunnel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Under the trivial degree of exhaustion which
will be necessary,&rdquo; says the Report of the Russian Engineer
Officer, &ldquo;rendering the tunnel sufficiently air-tight will
be far less difficult than is at first supposed.&nbsp; Indeed, I
see so many different ways of doing it,&rdquo; continues the
Report, &ldquo;that I am satisfied it would not, in practice,
prove more difficult than, nor, indeed, so difficult as, causing
some canals I have seen, to retain the water let into
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Following up the illustration which this
gentleman thus gives, I beg to assure you I will guarantee that
the tunnel shall not leak, or let air improperly in, so much as I
see the basin of your canal leaks water out.</p>
<p>Adverse as were the original circumstances of the great father
of canal navigation in England, yet did he put to signal shame
the opposition and predictions of the engineers who proclaimed
him a madman for pretending that it was possible to carry a canal
over a navigable river.&nbsp; Ten thousand times more mad as the
engineers of the present day proclaim me, and a hundred thousand
times more absurd and &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; as they have
pronounced my proposition to be, yet, owing to <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>having in my
favour (what Brindsley had not in his) the circumstance of my
principle having been tried, I am enabled to oppose to their
ridicule and sneers the FACT that I have proved it on a scale,
which, as relates to size, was fully, and in <i>every</i>
particular practical; while it was less than practical in point
of length, only because no individual could do that which it
requires a public company and an act of parliament to do, that
is, lay it down between places for actual trade.</p>
<p>Short, however, as it was, yet was it many times longer than
the pipes through which gas was first carried, to prove the
practicability of lighting our streets with that illuminator:
while its length was great enough to be equally conclusive, as
the movement of the first steam-vessel built by the introducer of
steam-navigation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When,&rdquo; says Fulton, &ldquo;I was building my
first steam-boat at New York, the project was viewed by the
public either with indifference or with contempt, as a visionary
scheme.&nbsp; My friends, indeed, were civil, but they were
shy.&nbsp; They listened with patience to my explanations; but
with a settled cast of incredulity on their countenances.&nbsp; I
felt the full force of the lamentation of the poet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Truths would you teach, to save a sinking
land,<br />
All fear, none aid you, and few understand.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;At length the day arrived when the experiment was to be
put into operation.&nbsp; To me it was a most trying and
interesting occasion.&nbsp; I invited many friends to go on
board, to witness the first successful trip.&nbsp; Many of them
did me the favour to attend as a matter of personal respect; but
it was manifest that they did it with reluctance, fearing to be
the partners of my mortification, and not of my triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moment arrived in which the word was to be given
for the vessel to move.&nbsp; My friends were in groups on the
deck.&nbsp; There was anxiety, mixed with fear, among them.&nbsp;
They were silent, and sad, and weary.&nbsp; I read in their looks
nothing but disaster; and almost repented of my efforts.&nbsp;
The signal was given; and the boat moved on a short distance, and
then stopped&mdash;and became immoveable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When <i>my</i> opponents can prove, that because
Fulton&rsquo;s first steam-vessel would, on its first trial, move
only the &ldquo;short distance&rdquo; stated in the above
quotation, it was, therefore, impossible to move any other vessel
farther by means of steam, I may heed the clamour they raise
about my proposition not being practicable through a long line of
tunnel.</p>
<p>Until then, I can consider it only as a proof of their
knowledge being on a par with the wisdom of that most learned
opponent of Galileo&rsquo;s theory that day and night are
occasioned by the revolution of our planet on its axis, who, in
answer to the query, &ldquo;How then is it that the sun gets back
to, and always rises in the east of a morning?&rdquo; replied,
that he went back by night, when nobody could see him.</p>
<p>In concluding, I will endeavour to guard against a
circumstance that may otherwise be injurious to me, by an
observation.&nbsp; You will perceive that the evidences which I
have quoted have been in existence six or seven years.&nbsp; How
then, it may be inquired, is it, that a method which is spoken of
so highly as those evidences speak of this mode of conveyance,
should have remained seven years without having been put into
actual practice, or brought any nearer to that consummation than
it was when those documents were written?</p>
<p>During the many years which elapsed between the period of
Columbus&rsquo;s first proposing to <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Ferdinand and Isabella the discovery
of America, and their actually setting him afloat to do it, he
sent his brother Bartholomew to England, to lay the proposition
before our Seventh Henry, who, he expected, would entertain
it.&nbsp; Henry did entertain it; and would have possessed
England of the southern more firmly than she afterwards became
possessed of the northern half of America, but for the misfortune
which prevented Bartholomew Columbus from approaching him, till
Isabella had agreed with, and dispatched Columbus himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In his voyage to England,&rdquo; says the historian of
America, &ldquo;Bartholomew Columbus had been so unfortunate as
to fall into the hands of pirates; who, having stripped him of
every thing, detained him a prisoner for several years:&rdquo;
reducing him to such poverty, that when released from captivity,
he could in no other way obtain the means of procuring a dress
fit for his appearance before the king, than by employing himself
in drawing maps.</p>
<p>Circumstances which, morally speaking, are <i>exactly</i>
similar to this captivity and imprisonment of Bartholomew
Columbus&mdash;excepting that they failed in compelling me to
sign away the patent rights, to wrest which from me they were
instituted&mdash;have equally hindered and reduced me:
occasioning the destruction of the tunnel which I constructed to
demonstrate, practically, the truth of the proposition; and
depriving me of all means of proving it, except by carrying small
things on an experimental scale, instead of persons on a
practical one.</p>
<p>As relates to myself, I have no desire to obtrude the details
of the oppression and injustice practised upon me, on any
one.</p>
<p>But with respect to the subject I advocate, I am most anxious
that the whole world should know that I court the <i>fullest</i>
inquiry, and am ready to answer <i>every</i> question.</p>
<p>As one proof of this, and to shew that there is nothing which
I need to blush for, any more than Bartholomew Columbus had cause
to blush for being imprisoned by the pirates, I beg to direct
your attention to the annexed copy of the Petition I presented to
Parliament; of which only an extract is given in page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page19">19</a></span>.&nbsp;

75</span>APPENDIX.</h2>
<p>AS the first evidence that &ldquo;the observations which will
be found in the course of this letter relative to the effects of
momentum, are not of such recent origin in my mind, as Mr.
Badnall states his idea relative to the undulatory railway to
have been in his,&rdquo; I observe, that in the specification of
my patent, after declining to level for the course of my tunnel
by cutting through hills or filling up vallies, as is done for
railways, I state, that I carry it up and down them (provided
they are not precipitously abrupt) for the reason, that
&ldquo;the momentum it (the carriage) may thus acquire, will be
advantageous in other ways than merely carrying itself
forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Secondly.&nbsp; The last sentence of the paragraph commencing
&ldquo;Tenthly,&rdquo; in the Report of the Russian Engineer
Officer, implies that that gentleman had understood what I have
stated relative to this effect of momentum, from my
communications to him.</p>
<p>Thirdly.&nbsp; The plan and section of the Brighton and
Shoreham Pneumatic Railway, which I deposited in the County Court
in 1827, and in Parliament at the beginning of the session of
1828, prove that the whole rise from Shoreham Harbour to the spot
on the <i>top</i> of the hill <i>above</i> Brighton (old) Church,
where I intended said Pneumatic Railway should terminate, was (I
forget the exact amount, but) about 180 feet: of which rise,
about 150 feet took place in the last half mile; giving a rate of
about 1 in 18: up which rise I looked to momentum, as the
<i>principal</i> means of getting the 100,000 tons of goods I
calculated on carrying between those places.</p>
<p>Fourthly.&nbsp; In my letter to Mr. Ricardo, in answer to his
pamphlet against me, I observe, that after totally omitting to
take into consideration the important effect which momentum
(<i>as well of the air itself as of the vehicle</i>) would have
in modifying the motion, and preventing the stoppage of the
carriage, in the way you describe at page 21, you exclaim,
&ldquo;This then, is a true philosophical explanation, of what
will take place in the action of a carriage impelled by
atmospheric pressure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Against such philosophy as this I protest, in justice both to
myself and the public.&nbsp; As the basis of lectures delivered
at your Mechanics&rsquo; Institution, where</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&ldquo;words of learned length and
thundering sound<br />
Amaze the <i>operatives</i> rang&rsquo;d around,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it may have sufficed.&nbsp; But when held up as a criterion by
which the public mind is to take its tone for my condemnation, I
am compelled to pronounce it philosophy of which its author ought
to be ashamed.</p>
<p>These evidences being all of dates several years anterior to
the period when Mr. Badnall states the idea of his
&ldquo;Undulating Railway&rdquo; first occurred to him, I shall
be liable to no charge of proposing to avail myself of momentum
<i>in consequence</i> of his having proposed
&ldquo;<i>Undulating</i> Railways.&rdquo;</p>

beyond Wavertree-lane is carried through a deep marle cutting,
under several massive stone archways, thrown across the
excavation to form the requisite communications between the roads
and farms on the opposite sides of the railway.&nbsp; Beyond the
marle cutting is the great rock excavation through Olive Mount,
about half a mile to the north of the village of Wavertree.&nbsp;
Here the traveller passes through a deep and narrow ravine, 70
feet below the surface of the ground, little more space being
opened out than sufficient for two trains of carriages to pass
each other; and the road winding gently round towards the
south-east, the prospect is bounded by the perpendicular rock on
either side, with the blue vault above, relieved at intervals by
a bridge high over head, connecting the opposite
precipices.&nbsp; At night, when the natural gloom of the place
is further deepened, the scene from the bridges above will
readily be imagined to be novel and striking.&nbsp; The light of
the moon illuminating about half the depth, and casting a darker
shade on the area below&mdash;the general silence interrupted at
intervals by a noise like distant thunder&mdash;presently a train
of carriages, led on by an engine of fire and steam, with her
lamps like two furnaces, throwing their light onward in dazzling
signal of their approach&mdash;with the strength and speed of a
war-horse the engine moves forward with its glorious cavalcade of
merchandize from all countries and passengers of all
nations.&nbsp; But the spectacle is transient as striking; in a
moment the pageant is gone&mdash;the meteor is passed; the
flaring of the lamps is only seen in the distance, and the
observer, looking down from the battlement above, perceives that
all again is still, and dark, and solitary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emerging from the Olive Mount cutting, you approach the
great Roby embankment, formed of the materials dug out of the
excavation we have described.&nbsp; This embankment stretches
across the valley for about two miles, varying in height from 15
to 45 feet, and in breadth at the base from 60 to 135 feet.&nbsp;
Here the traveller finds himself affected by sensations the very
reverse of what he felt a few minutes before.&nbsp; Mounted above
the tops of the trees, he looks around him over a wide expanse of
country, in the full enjoyment of the fresh breeze, from whatever
quarter it may blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This vast embankment strikingly exhibits how much may
be accomplished when our efforts are concentrated on one grand
object.&nbsp; There is a feeling of satisfaction by no means
common-place, in thus overcoming obstacles and surmounting
difficulties, in making the high places low and the rough places
plain, and advancing in one straight and direct course to the end
in view; while the pleasure afforded by the contemplation of this
great work is further enhanced, when considered in contrast with
ordinary and every-day impressions.&rdquo; p. 50&ndash;52.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few miles beyond Newton is the great Kenyon
excavation, from which about 800,000 cubic yards of clay and sand
have been dug out, part being carried to form the line of
embankment to the east and west of the cutting; and the
remainder, deposited as spoil banks, may be seen heaped up, like
Pelion upon Ossa, towering over the adjacent land.&rdquo; p.
55.</p>

crossing the low lands for about a mile between the Moss and the
Worsley Canal, over which the railway is carried by a neat stone
bridge.&rdquo; p. 57.</p>

mile and half which rises at the rate of 1 in 96 (up from l-6th
to l-3rd of which their momentum carries them) the part of the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway over which the locomotive
engines work, has no rise that is half so sharp as the 1 in 340,
nor any which is near so sharp as the 1 in 528, adverted to on
the Bristol line, it surpasses my comprehension to conceive what
there can possibly be to &ldquo;render the locomotive engines

I might now lay down, would be ten times stronger than that I
laid down at Brighton.</p>

of resistances to bodies moving through still air, at rates
varying from two to thirteen miles an hour, says, &ldquo;The

velocity; but gradually increasing more and more <i>above</i>
that proportion as the velocity increases.&rdquo;</p>

engine with which Watt first proved his principle was not equal
to a <i>dog&rsquo;s</i> power.&nbsp; There is one now in Cornwall
said to be of 1000 horses power.</p>
<p>In our first steam-boats, engines of only two or three horses
power could be employed; and the proposition to use larger ones
was met by the usual exclamation, &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;&nbsp;
We have now many steam vessels in which engines of 200 hones
power are employed; while there is one in which they are above
300 horses power.</p>

<p>Independent of the large air-pumps which the iron masters
themselves use, those I put up to exhaust air from the tunnel
which I constructed at Brighton would, if worked at an
extraordinary rate, have pumped five hundred thousand gallons per

class="footnote">[48b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Having performed what was
due to his country, Columbus was so little discouraged by the
repulse which he had received, that, instead of relinquishing his
undertaking, he pursued it with fresh ardour.&nbsp; He made his
next overture to John II. king of Portugal, in whose dominions he
had been long established, and whom he considered, on that
account, as having the second claim to his service.&nbsp; Here
every circumstance seemed to promise him a more favourable
reception.&nbsp; He applied to a monarch of an enterprising
genius, no incompetent judge in naval affairs, and proud of
patronising every attempt to discover new countries.&nbsp; His
subjects were the most experienced navigators in Europe, and the
least apt to be intimidated, either by the novelty or boldness of
any maritime expedition.&nbsp; In Portugal, the professional
skill of Columbus, as well as his personal good qualities, were
thoroughly known; and as the former rendered it probable that his
scheme was not altogether visionary, the latter exempted him from
the suspicion of any sinister intention in proposing it.&nbsp;
Accordingly, the king listened to him in the most gracious
manner, and referred the consideration of his plan to Diego
Ortiz, bishop of Ceuta, and two Jewish physicians, eminent
cosmographers, whom he was accustomed to consult in matters of
this kind.&nbsp; As in Genoa, ignorance had opposed and
disappointed Columbus; in Lisbon, he had to combat with
prejudice, an enemy no less formidable.&nbsp; The persons,
according to whose decision his scheme was to be adopted or
rejected, had been the chief directors of the Portuguese
navigations, and had advised to search for a passage to India, by
steering a course directly opposite to that which Columbus
recommended as shorter and more certain.&nbsp; They could not,
therefore, approve of his proposal, without submitting to the
double mortification, of condemning their own theory, and of
acknowledging his superior sagacity.&nbsp; After teasing him with
captious questions, and starting innumerable objections, with a
view of betraying him into such a particular explanation of his
system, as might draw from him a full discovery of its nature,
they deferred passing a final judgment with respect to it.&nbsp;
In the mean time, they conspired to rob him of the honour and
advantages which he expected from the success of his scheme,
advising the king to dispatch a vessel secretly, in order to
attempt the proposed discovery, by following exactly the course
which Columbus seemed to point out.&nbsp; John, forgetting on
this occasion, the sentiments becoming a monarch, meanly adopted
this perfidious counsel.&nbsp; But the pilot, chosen to execute
Columbus&rsquo;s plan, had neither the genius, nor the fortitude
of its author.&nbsp; Contrary winds arose, no sight of
approaching land appeared, his courage failed, and he returned to
Lisbon, execrating the project as equally extravagant and
dangerous.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Robertson&rsquo;s America</i>,

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
